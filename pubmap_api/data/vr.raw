Risk factors for Epstein-Barr virus reactivation after renal transplantation: Results of a large, multi-centre study.	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation is a very common and potentially lethal complication of renal transplantation. However, its risk factors and effects on transplant outcome are not well known. Here, we have analysed a large, multi-centre cohort (N = 512) in which 18.4% of the patients experienced EBV reactivation during the first post-transplant year. The patients were characterized pre-transplant and two weeks post-transplant by a multi-level biomarker panel. EBV reactivation was episodic for most patients, only 12 patients showed prolonged viraemia for over four months. Pre-transplant EBV shedding and male sex were associated with significantly increased incidence of post-transplant EBV reactivation. Importantly, we also identified a significant association of post-transplant EBV with acute rejection and with decreased haemoglobin levels. No further severe complications associated with EBV, either episodic or chronic, could be detected. Our data suggest that despite relatively frequent EBV reactivation, it had no association with serious complications during the first post-transplantation year. EBV shedding prior to transplantation could be employed as biomarkers for personalized immunosuppressive therapy. In summary, our results support the employed immunosuppressive regimes as relatively safe with regard to EBV. However, long-term studies are paramount to support these conclusions.

Reactive T Cells in Convalescent COVID-19 Patients With Negative SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Serology.	Despite RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19, specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike are undetectable in serum in approximately 10% of convalescent patients after mild disease course. This raises the question of induction and persistence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in these convalescent individuals. Using flow cytometry, we assessed specific SARS-CoV-2 and human endemic coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, -OC43) reactive T cells after stimulation with spike and nucleocapsid peptide pools and analyzed cytokine polyfunctionality (IFN	Frontiers in immunology	2021-07-30	10.3389/fimmu.2021.687449	['Steiner,S', 'Schwarz,T', 'Corman,VM', 'Sotzny,F', 'Bauer,S', 'Drosten,C', 'Volk,HD', 'Scheibenbogen,C', 'Hanitsch,LG']	['Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Virology, and German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), associated partner, Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Virology, and German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), associated partner, Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Virology, and German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), associated partner, Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies (BeCAT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health at Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charitéplatz 1, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin and Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Institute of Medical Immunology, Augustenburger Platz 1, Berlin, Germany.']
Detection of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in unexposed renal transplant patients.	"Recent data demonstrate potentially protective pre-existing T cells reactive against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in samples of healthy blood donors, collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Whether pre-existing immunity is also detectable in immunosuppressed patients is currently not known.
Fifty-seven patients were included in this case-control study. We compared the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in the samples of 20 renal transplant (RTx) patients to 20 age/gender matched non-immunosuppressed/immune competent healthy individuals collected before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Seventeen coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were used as positive controls. T cell reactivity against Spike-, Nucleocapsid-, and Membrane- SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Antibodies were analyzed by neutralization assay.
Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were detected in the majority of unexposed patients and healthy individuals. In RTx patients, 13/20 showed CD4
This study shows that the magnitude and functionality of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell in transplant patients is non-inferior compared to the immune competent cohort. Although several pro-inflammatory cytokines were produced by the detected T cells, further studies are required to prove their antiviral protection."

Generation of 20 human induced pluripotent stem cell lines from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).	Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a major cause of familial nephrotic syndrome. We generated 20 induced pluripotent stem cell lines from patients diagnosed with FSGS. The iPSC lines include 8 female and 12 male lines and cover a donor age range from 31 to 78. The lines were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by integration-free reprogramming using Sendai virus vectors. Cell lines were fully characterized regarding their pluripotency and differentiation potential, and quality controlled for karyotypic integrity, identity and clearance of reprogramming vectors. The generated cell lines represent a valuable tool for disease modelling and drug development for FSGS.

Reduction of immunosuppression combined with whole-brain radiotherapy and concurrent systemic rituximab is an effective yet toxic treatment of primary central nervous system post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (pCNS-PTLD): 14 cases from the prospective German PTLD registry.	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) exclusively affecting the central nervous system-primary CNS-PTLD (pCNS-PTLD)-are rare. There is no standard therapy, and previous case series have included heterogeneous treatment approaches. We performed a retrospective, multi-centre analysis of 14 patients with pCNS-PTLD after solid organ transplantation (SOT) treated in the prospective German PTLD registry with reduction of immunosuppression (RI), whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and concurrent systemic rituximab between 2001 and 2018. Twelve of fourteen patients were kidney transplant recipients and median age at diagnosis was 65 years. Thirteen of fourteen cases (93%) were monomorphic PTLD of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma type, and 12/13 were EBV-associated.

SARS-CoV-2 in severe COVID-19 induces a TGF-β-dominated chronic immune response that does not target itself.	The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 reflects an inefficient immune reaction to SARS-CoV-2. Here we analyze, at the single cell level, plasmablasts egressed into the blood to study the dynamics of adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. Before seroconversion in response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, peripheral plasmablasts display a type 1 interferon-induced gene expression signature; however, following seroconversion, plasmablasts lose this signature, express instead gene signatures induced by IL-21 and TGF-β, and produce mostly IgG1 and IgA1. In the sustained immune reaction from COVID-19 patients, plasmablasts shift to the expression of IgA2, thereby reflecting an instruction by TGF-β. Despite their continued presence in the blood, plasmablasts are not found in the lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients, nor does patient IgA2 binds to the dominant antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Our results thus suggest that, in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a chronic immune reaction that is instructed by TGF-β, and is distracted from itself.

Preformed T cell alloimmunity and HLA eplet mismatch to guide immunosuppression minimization with tacrolimus monotherapy in kidney transplantation: Results of the CELLIMIN trial.	Personalizing immunosuppression is a major objective in transplantation. Transplant recipients are heterogeneous regarding their immunological memory and primary alloimmune susceptibility. This biomarker-guided trial investigated whether in low immunological-risk kidney transplants without pretransplant DSA and donor-specific T cells assessed by a standardized IFN-γ ELISPOT, low immunosuppression (LI) with tacrolimus monotherapy would be non-inferior regarding 6-month BPAR than tacrolimus-based standard of care (SOC). Due to low recruitment rates, the trial was terminated when 167 patients were enrolled. ELISPOT negatives (E-) were randomized to LI (n = 48) or SOC (n = 53), E+ received the same SOC. Six- and 12-month BPAR rates were higher among LI than SOC/E- (4/35 [13%] vs. 1/43 [2%], p = .15 and 12/48 [25%] vs. 6/53 [11.3%], p = .073, respectively). E+ patients showed similarly high BPAR rates than LI at 6 and 12 months (12/55 [22%] and 13/66 [20%], respectively). These differences were stronger in per-protocol analyses. Post-hoc analysis revealed that poor class-II eplet matching, especially DQ, discriminated E- patients, notably E-/LI, developing BPAR (4/28 [14%] low risk vs. 8/20 [40%] high risk, p = .043). Eplet mismatch also predicted anti-class-I (p = .05) and anti-DQ (p < .001) de novo DSA. Adverse events were similar, but E-/LI developed fewer viral infections, particularly polyoma-virus-associated nephropathy (p = .021). Preformed T cell alloreactivity and HLA eplet mismatch assessment may refine current baseline immune-risk stratification and guide immunosuppression decision-making in kidney transplantation.

Disease Severity, Fever, Age, and Sex Correlate With SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Antibody Responses.	Clinical trials on the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma remain inconclusive. While data on safety is increasingly available, evidence for efficacy is still sparse. Subgroup analyses hint to a dose-response relationship between convalescent plasma neutralizing antibody levels and mortality. In particular, patients with primary and secondary antibody deficiency might benefit from this approach. However, testing of neutralizing antibodies is limited to specialized biosafety level 3 laboratories and is a time- and labor-intense procedure. In this single center study of 206 COVID-19 convalescent patients, clinical data, results of commercially available ELISA testing of SARS-CoV-2 spike-IgG and -IgA, and levels of neutralizing antibodies, determined by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT), were analyzed. At a medium time point of 58 days after symptom onset, only 12.6% of potential plasma donors showed high levels of neutralizing antibodies (PRNT50 ≥ 1:320).

Sex-Associated Differences in Cytomegalovirus Prevention: Prophylactic Strategy is Potentially Associated With a Strong Kidney Function Impairment in Female Renal Transplant Patients.	Post-transplantation cytomegalovirus (CMV) syndrome can be prevented using the antiviral drug (val)ganciclovir. (Val)ganciclovir is typically administered following a prophylactic or a pre-emptive strategy. The prophylactic strategy entails early universal administration, the pre-emptive strategy, early treatment in case of infection. However, it is not clear which strategy is superior with respect to transplantation outcome; sex-specific effects of these prevention strategies are not known. We have retrospectively analyzed 540 patients from the multi-centre Harmony study along eight pre-defined visits: 308 were treated according to a prophylactic, 232 according to a pre-emptive strategy. As expected, we observed an association of prophylactic strategy with lower incidence of CMV syndrome, delayed onset and lower viral loads compared to the pre-emptive strategy. However, in female patients, the prophylactic strategy was associated with a strong impairment of glomerular filtration rate one year post-transplant (difference: -11.8 ± 4.3 ml min	Frontiers in pharmacology	2021-02-02	10.3389/fphar.2020.534681	['Blazquez-Navarro,A', 'Dang-Heine,C', 'Bauer,C', 'Wittenbrink,N', 'Wolk,K', 'Sabat,R', 'Witzke,O', 'Westhoff,TH', 'Sawitzki,B', 'Reinke,P', 'Thomusch,O', 'Hugo,C', 'Babel,N', 'Or-Guil,M']	['Department of Biology, Systems Immunology Lab, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nCenter for Translational Medicine, Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Herne, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nClinical Study Center (CSC), Berlin Institute of Health, and Charitét - Universitättsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitätt Berlin, Humboldt-Universitätt Zu Berlin, Campus Charitét Mitte Berlin, Germany.', 'MicroDiscovery GmbH, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Systems Immunology Lab, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nDepartment of Dermatology and Allergy, Psoriasis Research and Treatment Center, Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Psoriasis Research and Treatment Center, Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nDepartment of Dermatology and Allergy, Interdisciplinary Group of Molecular Immunopathology, Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Klinik für Infektiologie, Universitätsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Center for Translational Medicine, Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Herne, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies (BeCAT), Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Klinik für Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie, Universitätsklinikum Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III - Bereich Nephrologie, Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Berlin-Brandenburger Centrum für Regenerative Therapien, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nCenter for Translational Medicine, Universitätsklinikum der Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Herne, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Systems Immunology Lab, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nInstitute of Medical Immunology, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']
Targeted De-Methylation of the FOXP3-TSDR Is Sufficient to Induce Physiological FOXP3 Expression but Not a Functional Treg Phenotype.	CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key mediators of immunological tolerance and promising effector cells for immuno-suppressive adoptive cellular therapy to fight autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. Their functional stability is critical for their clinical utility and has been correlated to the demethylated state of the TSDR/CNS2 enhancer element in the Treg lineage transcription factor FOXP3. However, proof for a causal contribution of the TSDR de-methylation to FOXP3 stability and Treg induction is so far lacking. We here established a powerful transient-transfection CRISPR-Cas9-based epigenetic editing method for the selective de-methylation of the TSDR within the endogenous chromatin environment of a living cell. The induced de-methylated state was stable over weeks in clonal T cell proliferation cultures even after expression of the editing complex had ceased. Epigenetic editing of the TSDR resulted in FOXP3 expression, even in its physiological isoform distribution, proving a causal role for the de-methylated TSDR in FOXP3 regulation. However, successful FOXP3 induction was not associated with a switch towards a functional Treg phenotype, in contrast to what has been reported from FOXP3 overexpression approaches. Thus, TSDR de-methylation is required, but not sufficient for a stable Treg phenotype induction. Therefore, targeted demethylation of the TSDR may be a critical addition to published 	Frontiers in immunology	2021-01-26	10.3389/fimmu.2020.609891	['Kressler,C', 'Gasparoni,G', 'Nordström,K', 'Hamo,D', 'Salhab,A', 'Dimitropoulos,C', 'Tierling,S', 'Reinke,P', 'Volk,HD', 'Walter,J', 'Hamann,A', 'Polansky,JK']	['Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nImmuno-Epigenetics, German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany.', 'Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', 'Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nImmuno-Epigenetics, German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany.', 'Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', 'Immuno-Epigenetics, German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany.', 'Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies (BeCAT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies (BeCAT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Genetics/Epigenetics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany.', 'Immuno-Epigenetics, German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nImmuno-Epigenetics, German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ), Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies (BeCAT), Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']

HCoV- and SARS-CoV-2 Cross-Reactive T Cells in CVID Patients.	The inability of patients with CVID to mount specific antibody responses to pathogens has raised concerns on the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there might be a role for protective T cells in these patients. SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals. Until now, there is no data on T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVID. This study aimed to evaluate reactive T cells to human endemic corona viruses (HCoV) and to study pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in unexposed CVID patients. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2- and HCoV-229E and -OC43 reactive T cells in response to seven peptide pools, including spike and nucleocapsid (NCAP) proteins, in 11 unexposed CVID, 12 unexposed and 11 post COVID-19 healthy controls (HC). We further characterized reactive T cells by IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 profiles. SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive CD4+ T cells were detected in 7 of 11 unexposed CVID patients, albeit with fewer multifunctional (IFNγ/TNFα/IL-2) cells than unexposed HC. CVID patients had no SARS-CoV-2 NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells and less reactive CD8+ cells compared to unexposed HC. We observed a correlation between T cell reactivity against spike of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in unexposed, but not post COVID-19 HC, suggesting cross-reactivity. T cell responses in post COVID-19 HC could be distinguished from unexposed HC by higher frequencies of triple-positive NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells are detectable in unexposed CVID patients albeit with lower recognition frequencies and polyfunctional potential.

Activity and components of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor pathway in hidradenitis suppurativa.	"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory disease, characterized by painful, purulent and destructive skin alterations in intertriginous areas.
We investigated the expression and role in HS of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the regulator of neutrophil biology, as clinical signs of a neutrophilic granulocyte-driven inflammation are distinctive in the disease.
Skin and blood samples obtained from different cohorts of patients with HS and control individuals were assessed by RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed mRNA, and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mechanistic studies using keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, immune cell populations and skin biopsies were performed.
G-CSF was abundant in HS skin, particularly in inflamed nodules and abscesses. Its levels even exceeded those found in other inflammatory skin diseases. Interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-17, respectively, induced G-CSF production by fibroblasts and keratinocytes. These effects were enhanced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-36. Accordingly, fibroblasts separated from HS lesions expressed G-CSF, and IL-1 receptor antagonist reduced G-CSF levels in explanted HS skin. G-CSF blood levels positively correlated with severity of HS. Elevated lesional G-CSF receptor levels were linked to upregulation of molecules that contribute to prolonged activation of neutrophils by components of bacteria and damaged host cells [formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), FPR2 and free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)], neutrophil survival [TNF receptor superfamily member 10C (TNFRSF10C/TRAIL-R3) and TNF receptor superfamily member 6B], kinases (tyrosine-protein kinase HCK and hexokinase 3), and skin destruction [MMP25 (matrix metalloproteinase 25) and ADAM8 (disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 8)]. G-CSF elevated the expression of FPR1, FFAR2, and TNFRSF10C/TRAIL-R3 in neutrophils and synergized with bacterial components to induce skin-destructive enzymes.
The G-CSF pathway engages both tissue and immune cells, is strongly activated in HS lesions, and offers the opportunity to target the neutrophil-driven inflammation."

T cell phenotypes associated with insulin resistance: results from the Berlin Aging Study II.	"Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation leading to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, but a subset of obese individuals is considered insulin sensitive (IS). The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain elusive and clinical studies on the relationship between inflammatory markers and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) are scarce.
In this cross-sectional analysis, we included a sample of 437 older participants (60-84 years) from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, immune cell subsets were analyzed with multiparameter flow cytometry and systemic cytokine levels were measured. Immune cell parameters were correlated with metabolic measures and multiple linear regression analysis was conducted and adjusted for various demographic and clinical factors.
We found that frequencies of naïve and memory CD4
These findings support the hypothesis that parameters of systemic inflammation can differentiate IS from IR obese individuals that are at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases and may have clinical implications with regard to obesity treatment stratification.

T cell receptor repertoires within liver allografts are different to those in the peripheral blood.	"T cells are the main mediators of allogeneic immune responses. Specific T cell clones can be tracked by their unique T cell receptor (TCR), but specificity and function remain elusive and have not been investigated in human liver biopsies thus far.
TCR repertoire analysis of CD4
Although overall clonality of the TCR repertoire did not increase in peripheral blood after liver transplantation, clonality of donor-reactive CD4
This is the first study comparing TCR repertoires between liver grafts and blood in patients with NR, SCR, and ACR. Moreover, we attribute specificity and function to a subgroup of intragraft T cell populations. Given the limited overlap between peripheral blood and intragraft repertoires, future studies investigating function and specificities of T cells after liver transplantation should focus on the intragraft immune response.
In solid organ transplantation, T cells are key mediators of the recipient's immune response directed at the transplanted organ. In our study, we characterised the T cell repertoire in a cohort of 7 liver transplant recipients. We demonstrate that donor-specific T cells expand clonally and accumulate in the transplanted liver. Moreover, we show that the composition of T cells in peripheral blood differs from the T cells in the liver allograft, only aligning in the context of acute cellular rejection but not in normal graft or subclinical cellular rejection. This indicates that the intragraft immune response is not mirrored in the peripheral blood. Our findings clarify the importance of protocol liver biopsies in identifying intragraft immune responses for future investigations of allo-directed immune responses."

Tilting in coronene layers on Au(111).	Control of molecule adsorption and ordering on metal surfaces is of critical importance for the design and fabrication of molecule-based functional materials. In the present work, the molecule layer structures of coronene on Au(111) and HOPG are studied by combining scanning tunneling microscopy with image analysis techniques to unravel small changes in molecule adsorption geometry. Coronene forms a densely packed layer on Au(111) and HOPG at room temperature, but does not preferentially decorate the herringbone reconstruction. The molecule layer structure is confirmed by histograms of molecule radius and apparent height obtained from STM images using a python based open source code. Annealing at 116 °C initiates a tilting of coronene molecules on Au(111) by about 11 ± 4° which is deduced from statistical image analysis. The structural analysis is combined with an assessment of apparent height modulation with bias voltage to ascertain the reliability of the statistical analysis. Our work illustrates that the combination of advanced image analysis processing and STM images allows one to extract even small changes in a molecule layer structure.

Regulatory T cells for minimising immune suppression in kidney transplantation: phase I/IIa clinical trial.	"To assess whether reshaping of the immune balance by infusion of autologous natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) in patients after kidney transplantation is safe, feasible, and enables the tapering of lifelong high dose immunosuppression, with its limited efficacy, adverse effects, and high direct and indirect costs, along with addressing several key challenges of nTreg treatment, such as easy and robust manufacturing, danger of over immunosuppression, interaction with standard care drugs, and functional stability in an inflammatory environment in a useful proof-of-concept disease model.
Investigator initiated, monocentre, nTreg dose escalation, phase I/IIa clinical trial (ONEnTreg13).
Charité-University Hospital, Berlin, Germany, within the ONE study consortium (funded by the European Union).
Recipients of living donor kidney transplant (ONEnTreg13, n=11) and corresponding reference group trial (ONErgt11-CHA, n=9).
CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ nTreg products were given seven days after kidney transplantation as one intravenous dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5-3.0×10
The primary clinical and safety endpoints were assessed by a composite endpoint at week 60 with further three year follow-up. The assessment included incidence of biopsy confirmed acute rejection, assessment of nTreg infusion related adverse effects, and signs of over immunosuppression. Secondary endpoints addressed allograft functions. Accompanying research included a comprehensive exploratory biomarker portfolio.
For all patients, nTreg products with sufficient yield, purity, and functionality could be generated from 40-50 mL of peripheral blood taken two weeks before kidney transplantation. None of the three nTreg dose escalation groups had dose limiting toxicity. The nTreg and reference groups had 100% three year allograft survival and similar clinical and safety profiles. Stable monotherapy immunosuppression was achieved in eight of 11 (73%) patients receiving nTregs, while the reference group remained on standard dual or triple drug immunosuppression (P=0.002). Mechanistically, the activation of conventional T cells was reduced and nTregs shifted in vivo from a polyclonal to an oligoclonal T cell receptor repertoire.
The application of autologous nTregs was safe and feasible even in patients who had a kidney transplant and were immunosuppressed. These results warrant further evaluation of Treg efficacy and serve as the basis for the development of next generation nTreg approaches in transplantation and any immunopathologies.

Differential immunological signature at the culprit site distinguishes acute coronary syndrome with intact from acute coronary syndrome with ruptured fibrous cap: results from the prospective translational OPTICO-ACS study.	"Acute coronary syndromes with intact fibrous cap (IFC-ACS), i.e. caused by coronary plaque erosion, account for approximately one-third of ACS. However, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms as compared with ACS caused by plaque rupture (RFC-ACS) remain largely undefined. The prospective translational OPTICO-ACS study programme investigates for the first time the microenvironment of ACS-causing culprit lesions (CL) with intact fibrous cap by molecular high-resolution intracoronary imaging and simultaneous local immunological phenotyping.
The CL of 170 consecutive ACS patients were investigated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and simultaneous immunophenotyping by flow cytometric analysis as well as by effector molecule concentration measurements across the culprit lesion gradient (ratio local/systemic levels). Within the study cohort, IFC caused 24.6% of ACS while RFC-ACS caused 75.4% as determined and validated by two independent OCT core laboratories. The IFC-CL were characterized by lower lipid content, less calcification, a thicker overlying fibrous cap, and largely localized near a coronary bifurcation as compared with RFC-CL. The microenvironment of IFC-ACS lesions demonstrated selective enrichment in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes (+8.1% and +11.2%, respectively, both P < 0.05) as compared with RFC-ACS lesions. T-cell-associated extracellular circulating microvesicles (MV) were more pronounced in IFC-ACS lesions and a significantly higher amount of CD8+ T-lymphocytes was detectable in thrombi aspirated from IFC-culprit sites. Furthermore, IFC-ACS lesions showed increased levels of the T-cell effector molecules granzyme A (+22.4%), perforin (+58.8%), and granulysin (+75.4%) as compared with RFC plaques (P < 0.005). Endothelial cells subjected to culture in disturbed laminar flow conditions, i.e. to simulate coronary flow near a bifurcation, demonstrated an enhanced adhesion of CD8+T cells. Finally, both CD8+T cells and their cytotoxic effector molecules caused endothelial cell death, a key potential pathophysiological mechanism in IFC-ACS.
The OPTICO-ACS study emphasizes a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of IFC-ACS, favouring participation of the adaptive immune system, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and their effector molecules. The different immune signatures identified in this study advance the understanding of coronary plaque progression and may provide a basis for future development of personalized therapeutic approaches to ACS with IFC.
The study was registered at clinicalTrials.gov (NCT03129503)."

CRISPR-Cas9-Edited Tacrolimus-Resistant Antiviral T Cells for Advanced Adoptive Immunotherapy in Transplant Recipients.	Viral infections, such as with cytomegalovirus (CMV), remain a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity of transplant recipients because of their requirement for lifelong immunosuppression (IS). Antiviral drugs often cause toxicity and sometimes fail to control disease. Thus, regeneration of the antiviral immune response by adoptive antiviral T cell therapy is an attractive alternative. Our recent data, however, show only short-term efficacy in some solid organ recipients, possibly because of malfunction in transferred T cells caused by ongoing IS. We developed a vector-free clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-based good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant protocol that efficiently targets and knocks out the gene for the adaptor protein FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), required for the immunosuppressive function of tacrolimus. This was achieved by transient delivery of ribonucleoprotein complexes into CMV-specific T cells by electroporation. We confirmed the tacrolimus resistance of our gene-edited T cell products in vitro and demonstrated performance comparable with non-tacrolimus-treated unmodified T cells. The alternative calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A can be administered as a safety switch to shut down tacrolimus-resistant T cell activity in case of adverse effects. Furthermore, we performed safety assessments as a prerequisite for translation to first-in-human applications.

The herbal extract EPs® 7630 increases the antimicrobial airway defense through monocyte-dependent induction of IL-22 in T cells.	The phytotherapeutic compound EPs® 7630, an extract manufactured from Pelargonium sidoides roots, is frequently used for the treatment of airway infections. Nevertheless, the knowledge of the mode of action of EPs® 7630 is still sparse. Our study aimed at further elucidating the underlying pharmacological mechanisms by focusing on antimicrobial defense mechanisms of EPs® 7630. While investigating the influence of EPs® 7630 on lymphokine production by PBMCs, we found that EPs® 7630 is a novel inducer of IL-22 and IL-17. This cytokine-inducing effect was most pronounced for IL-22 and clearly dose-dependent starting from 1 μg/ml of the extract. Furthermore, EPs® 7630 pretreatment selectively enhanced the IL-22 and IL-17 production capacity of CD3/28-activated PBMCs while strongly limiting the IFN-γ production capacity of innate lymphoid cells. The relevance of EPs® 7630-induced IL-22 production was proven in vitro and in vivo, where IL-22 provoked a strong increase of the antimicrobial protein S100A9 in lung epithelial cells and pulmonary tissue, respectively. A detailed analysis of IL-22 induction modi revealed no direct influence of EPs® 7630 on the basal or anti-CD3/CD28 antibody-induced IL-22 production by CD4	Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)	2020-09-20	10.1007/s00109-020-01970-3	['Witte,K', 'Koch,E', 'Volk,HD', 'Wolk,K', 'Sabat,R']	['Interdisciplinary Group of Molecular Immunopathology Dermatology/Medical Immunology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBIH Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charité - Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co.

The H-Y Antigen in Embryonic Stem Cells Causes Rejection in Syngeneic Female Recipients.	Pluripotent stem cells are promising candidates for cell-based regenerative therapies. To avoid rejection of transplanted cells, several approaches are being pursued to reduce immunogenicity of the cells or modulate the recipient's immune response. These include gene editing to reduce the antigenicity of cell products, immunosuppression of the host, or using major histocompatibility complex-matched cells from cell banks. In this context, we have investigated the antigenicity of H-Y antigens, a class of minor histocompatibility antigens encoded by the Y chromosome, to assess whether the gender of the donor affects the cell's antigenicity. In a murine transplant model, we show that the H-Y antigen in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), as well as ESC-derived endothelial cells, provokes T- and B cell responses in female recipients.

MSC Therapies for COVID-19: Importance of Patient Coagulopathy, Thromboprophylaxis, Cell Product Quality and Mode of Delivery for Treatment Safety and Efficacy.	Numerous clinical trials of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) as a new treatment for coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) have been registered recently, most of them based on intravenous (IV) infusion. There is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19, but MSC therapies have shown first promise in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, inflammation, and sepsis, which are among the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments. We here propose three steps to mitigate the risk for these vulnerable patients: (1) updated clinical guidelines for cell and tissue transplantation, (2) updated minimal criteria for characterization of cellular therapeutics, and (3) updated cell therapy routines reflecting specific patient needs.

Transient antibody targeting of CD45RC inhibits the development of graft-versus-host disease.	Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a widely spread treatment of many hematological diseases, but its most important side effect is graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Despite the development of new therapies, acute GVHD (aGVHD) occurs in 30% to 50% of allogeneic BMT and is characterized by the generation of effector T (Teff) cells with production of inflammatory cytokines. We previously demonstrated that a short anti-CD45RC monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment in a heart allograft rat model transiently decreased CD45RChigh Teff cells and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) number and function allowing long-term donor-specific tolerance. Here, we demonstrated in rat and mouse allogeneic GVHD, as well as in xenogeneic GVHD mediated by human T cells in NSG mice, that both ex vivo depletion of CD45RChigh T cells and in vivo treatment with short-course anti-CD45RC mAbs inhibited aGVHD. In the rat model, we demonstrated that long surviving animals treated with anti-CD45RC mAbs were fully engrafted with donor cells and developed a donor-specific tolerance. Finally, we validated the rejection of a human tumor in NSG mice infused with human cells and treated with anti-CD45RC mAbs. The anti-human CD45RC mAbs showed a favorable safety profile because it did not abolish human memory antiviral immune responses, nor trigger cytokine release in in vitro assays. Altogether, our results show the potential of a prophylactic treatment with anti-human CD45RC mAbs in combination with rapamycin as a new therapy to treat aGVHD without abolishing the antitumor effect.

Association between Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Inflammation, Insulin Resistance, and Calorie Restriction in Obese Females.	The worldwide epidemic of overweight and obesity has led to an increase in associated metabolic comorbidities. Obesity induces chronic low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue (WAT). However, the function and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells in human WAT under conditions of obesity and calorie restriction (CR) is not fully understood yet. Using a randomized interventional design, we investigated postmenopausal overweight or obese female subjects who either underwent CR for 3 mo followed by a 4-wk phase of weight maintenance or had to maintain a stable weight over the whole study period. A comprehensive immune phenotyping protocol was conducted using validated multiparameter flow cytometry analysis in blood and s.c. WAT (SAT). The TCR repertoire was analyzed by next-generation sequencing and cytokine levels were determined in SAT. Metabolic parameters were determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. We found that insulin resistance correlates significantly with a shift toward the memory T cell compartment in SAT. TCR analysis revealed a diverse repertoire in SAT of overweight or obese individuals. Additionally, whereas weight loss improved systemic insulin sensitivity in the intervention group, SAT displayed no significant improvement of inflammatory parameters (cytokine levels and leukocyte subpopulations) compared with the control group. Our data demonstrate the accumulation of effector memory T cells in obese SAT and an association between systemic glucose homeostasis and inflammatory parameters in obese females. The long-standing effect of obesity-induced changes in SAT was demonstrated by preserved immune cell composition after short-term CR-induced weight loss.

Regulatory cell therapy in kidney transplantation (The ONE Study): a harmonised design and analysis of seven non-randomised, single-arm, phase 1/2A trials.	"Use of cell-based medicinal products (CBMPs) represents a state-of-the-art approach for reducing general immunosuppression in organ transplantation. We tested multiple regulatory CBMPs in kidney transplant trials to establish the safety of regulatory CBMPs when combined with reduced immunosuppressive treatment.
The ONE Study consisted of seven investigator-led, single-arm trials done internationally at eight hospitals in France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA (60 week follow-up). Included patients were living-donor kidney transplant recipients aged 18 years and older. The reference group trial (RGT) was a standard-of-care group given basiliximab, tapered steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. Six non-randomised phase 1/2A cell therapy group (CTG) trials were pooled and analysed, in which patients received one of six CBMPs containing regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, or macrophages; patient selection and immunosuppression mirrored the RGT, except basiliximab induction was substituted with CBMPs and mycophenolate mofetil tapering was allowed. None of the trials were randomised and none of the individuals involved were masked. The primary endpoint was biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) within 60 weeks after transplantation; adverse event coding was centralised. The RTG and CTG trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01656135, NCT02252055, NCT02085629, NCT02244801, NCT02371434, NCT02129881, and NCT02091232.
The seven trials took place between Dec 11, 2012, and Nov 14, 2018. Of 782 patients assessed for eligibility, 130 (17%) patients were enrolled and 104 were treated and included in the analysis. The 66 patients who were treated in the RGT were 73% male and had a median age of 47 years. The 38 patients who were treated across six CTG trials were 71% male and had a median age of 45 years. Standard-of-care immunosuppression in the recipients in the RGT resulted in a 12% BCAR rate (expected range 3·2-18·0). The overall BCAR rate for the six parallel CTG trials was 16%. 15 (40%) patients given CBMPs were successfully weaned from mycophenolate mofetil and maintained on tacrolimus monotherapy. Combined adverse event data and BCAR episodes from all six CTG trials revealed no safety concerns when compared with the RGT. Fewer episodes of infections were registered in CTG trials versus the RGT.
Regulatory cell therapy is achievable and safe in living-donor kidney transplant recipients, and is associated with fewer infectious complications, but similar rejection rates in the first year. Therefore, immune cell therapy is a potentially useful therapeutic approach in recipients of kidney transplant to minimise the burden of general immunosuppression.

Adult Tissue Extracellular Matrix Determines Tissue Specification of Human iPSC-Derived Embryonic Stage Mesodermal Precursor Cells.	The selection of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived cells for tissue modeling and cell therapy will be influenced by their response to the tissue environment, including the extracellular matrix (ECM). Whether and how instructive memory is imprinted in adult ECM and able to impact on the tissue specific determination of human PSC-derived developmentally fetal mesodermal precursor (P-meso) cells is investigated. Decellularized ECM (dECM) is generated from human heart, kidney, and lung tissues and recellularized with P-meso cells in a medium not containing any differentiation inducing components. While P-meso cells on kidney dECM differentiate exclusively into nephronal cells, only beating clusters containing mature and immature cardiac cells form on heart dECM. No tissue-specific differentiation of P-meso cells is observed on endoderm-derived lung dECM. P-meso-derived endothelial cells, however, are found on all dECM preparations independent of tissue origin. Clearance of heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) from dECM abolishes induction of tissue-specific differentiation. It is concluded that HSPG-bound factors on adult tissue-derived ECM are essential and sufficient to induce tissue-specific specification of uncommitted fetal stage precursor cells.

Toward an Optimized Process for Clinical Manufacturing of CAR-Treg Cell Therapy.	Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology and its application to regulatory T cells (Tregs) has garnered interest among researchers in the field of cell and gene therapy. Merging the benefits of CAR technology with Tregs offers a novel and promising therapeutic option for durable reshaping of undesired immune responses following solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as in immune-related disorders. However, major challenges remain for developing a standardized and robust good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant manufacturing process for CAR-Treg cells. We review current progress in the field and recommend ways to improve CAR-Treg manufacturing processes based on lessons learned from first-generation Treg therapeutics as well as from anticancer CAR-T cell development.

Surgery for Renal Hyperparathyroidism in the Era of Cinacalcet: A Single-Center Experience.	"There are only few data on the influence of cinacalcet on the outcome of parathyroidectomy in patients with renal hyperparathyroidism. Indication and timing of surgery have changed since its introduction, especially with regard to kidney transplantation. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism in our institution.
Between 2008 and 2015, 196 consecutive operations in 191 patients were analyzed. About 80 operations (41%) were performed in patients receiving cinacalcet compared with 116 operations (59%) in patients without cinacalcet. Clinical data, preoperative medication, pre- and postoperative laboratory values, type and details of surgery including complications, as well as cardiovascular complications and kidney transplantation with graft function were recorded.
Demographical data were similar in patients with or without cinacalcet treatment. A total of 54% of patients received a kidney graft before or after parathyroidectomy. Pre- and postoperative parathormone levels were similar in both groups (preoperatively 755 vs 742 ng/L, postoperatively 50 vs 46 ng/L, p > 0.10), whereas patients with cinacalcet showed significantly lower calcium levels preoperatively (2.28 vs 2.41 mmol/L, p = 0.0002). There was no difference in recurrence or persistence of hyperparathyroidism, duration of surgery, hospital stay, or complication rate. Creatinine levels in patients with tertiary hyperparathyroidism were similar after 1-year follow-up.
Cinacalcet did not influence outcome of patients with parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism and can be safely offered to patients not responding to medical treatment."

The TreaT-Assay: A Novel Urine-Derived Donor Kidney Cell-Based Assay for Prediction of Kidney Transplantation Outcome.	Donor-reactive immunity plays a major role in rejection after kidney transplantation, but analysis of donor-reactive T-cells is not applied routinely. However, it has been shown that this could help to identify patients at risk of acute rejection. A major obstacle is the limited quantity or quality of the required allogenic stimulator cells, including a limited availability of donor-splenocytes or an insufficient HLA-matching with HLA-bank cells. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel assay, termed the TreaT (Transplant reactive T-cells)-assay. We cultivated renal tubular epithelial cells from the urine of kidney transplant patients and used them as stimulators for donor-reactive T-cells, which we analyzed by flow cytometry. We could demonstrate that using the TreaT-assay the quantification and characterization of alloreactive T-cells is superior to other stimulators. In a pilot study, the number of pre-transplant alloreactive T-cells negatively correlated with the post-transplant eGFR.

Increased presence and differential molecular imprinting of transit amplifying cells in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a very common chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal thickening and scaling resulting from keratinocyte hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation. Pathomechanistic studies in psoriasis are often limited by using whole skin tissue biopsies, neglecting their stratification and cellular diversity. This study aimed at characterizing epidermal alterations in psoriasis at the level of keratinocyte populations. Epidermal cell populations were purified from skin biopsies of psoriasis patients and healthy donors using a novel cell type-specific approach. Molecular characterization of the transit-amplifying cells (TAC), the key players of epidermal renewal, was performed using immunocytofluorescence-technique and integrated multiscale-omics analyses. Already TAC from non-lesional psoriatic skin showed altered methylation and differential expression in 1.7% and 1.0% of all protein-coding genes, respectively. In psoriatic lesions, TAC were strongly expanded showing further increased differentially methylated (10-fold) and expressed (22-fold) genes numbers. Importantly, 17.2% of differentially expressed genes were associated with respective gene methylations. Compared with non-lesional TAC, pathway analyses revealed metabolic alterations as one feature predominantly changed in TAC derived from active psoriatic lesions. Overall, our study showed stage-specific molecular alterations, allows new insights into the pathogenesis, and implies the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in lesion development in psoriasis. KEY MESSAGES: Transit amplifying cell (TAC) numbers are highly increased in psoriatic lesions Psoriatic TAC show profound molecular alterations & stage-specific identity TAC from unaffected areas already show first signs of molecular alterations Lesional TAC show a preference in metabolic-related alterations.

Mechanisms of Immune Tolerance in Liver Transplantation-Crosstalk Between Alloreactive T Cells and Liver Cells With Therapeutic Prospects.	Liver transplantation (LTx) is currently the most powerful treatment for end-stage liver disease. Although liver allograft is more tolerogenic compared to other solid organs, the majority of LTx recipients still require long-term immune suppression (IS) to control the undesired alloimmune responses, which can lead to severe side effects. Thus, understanding the mechanism of liver transplant tolerance and crosstalk between immune cells, especially alloreactive T cells and liver cells, can shed light on more specific tolerance induction strategies for future clinical translation. In this review, we focus on alloreactive T cell mediated immune responses and their crosstalk with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and cholangiocytes in transplant setting. Liver cells mainly serve as antigen presenting cells (APCs) to T cells, but with low expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Crosstalk between them largely depends on the different expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. Inflammatory cytokines secreted by immune cells further elaborate this crosstalk and regulate the fate of naïve T cells differentiation within the liver graft. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an essential role in inducing and keeping immune tolerance in LTx. Tregs based adoptive cell therapy provides an excellent therapeutic option for clinical transplant tolerance induction. However, many questions regarding cell therapy still need to be solved. Here we also address the current clinical trials of adoptive Tregs therapy and other tolerance induction strategies in LTx, together with future challenges for clinical translation from bench to bedside.

Asymmetries in social touch-motor and emotional biases on lateral preferences in embracing, cradling and kissing.	In human social interaction, affective touch plays an integral role to communicate intentions and emotions. Three of the most important forms of social touch are embracing, cradling and kissing. These behaviours have been demonstrated to be lateralized, but the underlying mechanisms are still not well understood. Both motor and emotive biases have been suggested to affect laterality of social touch. We aimed to systematically investigate how motor preferences and emotive biases influence the lateralization of embracing, cradling and kissing within the same sample. Participants performed all three forms of social touch in neutral, positive and negative emotional conditions. Like a previous study, we found a rightward bias for embracing that was modulated by both motor preferences and the emotional content of the situation. Kissing and cradling were not influenced by motor preferences. In general, a negative emotional connotation of the situation led to a reduction of lateral biases in social touch, independent of the individual direction.

Heterologous Cytomegalovirus and Allo-Reactivity by Shared T Cell Receptor Repertoire in Kidney Transplantation.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with allograft rejection but the mechanisms behind are poorly defined yet. Although cross-reactivity of T cells to alloantigen and CMV has been hypothesized, direct evidence in patients is lacking. In this observational cohort study, we tested the pre-transplant effector/memory T cell response to CMV peptide pools and alloantigen in 78 living donor/recipient pairs using the interferon-gamma Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) assay. To prove the hypothesis of cross-reactivity, we analyzed by applying next-generation sequencing the T cell receptor ß (TCR- ß) repertoire of CMV- and alloantigen-reactive T cells enriched from peripheral pre-transplant blood of 11 CMV-seropositive and HLA class I mismatched patients. Moreover, the TCR-repertoire was also analyzed in the allograft biopsies of those patients. There was a significant association between the presence of pre-transplant CMV immediate-early protein 1 (IE-1)-specific effector/memory T cells and acute renal allograft rejection and function (	Frontiers in immunology	2019-11-19	10.3389/fimmu.2019.02549	['Stranavova,L', 'Pelak,O', 'Svaton,M', 'Hruba,P', 'Fronkova,E', 'Slavcev,A', 'Osickova,K', 'Maluskova,J', 'Hubacek,P', 'Fronek,J', 'Reinke,P', 'Volk,HD', 'Kalina,T', 'Viklicky,O']	['Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunogenetics, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Nephrology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Transplant Pathology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine and Motol University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Department of Transplant Surgery, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.', 'BIH Centre for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin Centre for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'BIH Centre for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin Centre for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, 2nd Faculty of Medicine, Charles University Prague and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czechia.', 'Transplant Laboratory, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Transplant Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czechia.']
Preformed donor-reactive T cells that persist after ABO desensitization predict severe T cell-mediated rejection after living donor kidney transplantation - a retrospective study.	Preformed donor-reactive T cells are relatively resistant to standard immunosuppression and account for an increased incidence of T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and inferior kidney allograft outcomes. We analyzed 150 living donor kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) of a first kidney allograft. Ninety-eight ABO-compatible (ABOc) and 52 ABO-incompatible (ABOi) KTRs were included. Samples were collected at 6 time points, before rituximab, before immunoadsorption and pretransplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months posttransplantation, and donor-reactive T cells were measured by interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. Twenty of 98 ABOc (20%) and 12 of 52 ABOi KTRs (23%) showed positive pretransplant ELISPOT. Eight of 20 ABOc-KTRs (40%) with positive pretransplant ELISPOT showed TCMR, whereas 17 of 78 ABOc-KTRs (22%) with negative pretransplant ELISPOT did (P = 0.148). Seven of 12 ABOi KTRs (57%) with positive pretransplant ELISPOT showed TCMR, whereas only 3 of 40 ABOi KTRs (8%) with negative pretransplant ELISPOT did (P < 0.001). Interestingly, 6 of 7 ABOi KTRs with positive pretransplant ELISPOT that persists after ABO desensitization developed TCMR. Among 118 KTRs with negative pretransplant ELISPOT, 10 of 72 ABOc-KTRs (14%), but 0 of 46 ABOi KTRs, developed positive posttransplant ELISPOT (P = 0.006). Preformed donor-reactive T cells that persist despite ABO desensitization identify KTRs at highest risk of TCMR. Less de-novo donor-reactive T cells after ABO desensitization may account for less TCMR. Both, the use of rituximab and early initiation of calcineurin inhibitor-based maintenance immunosuppression may contribute to these findings.

Diagnostic biomarkers for adult haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in critically ill patients (HEMICU): a prospective observational study protocol.	"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in adults is characterised by toxic immune activation and a sepsis-like syndrome, leading to high numbers of undiagnosed cases and mortality rates of up to 68%. Early diagnosis and specific immune suppressive treatment are mandatory to avoid fatal outcome, but the diagnostic criteria (HLH-2004) are adopted from paediatric HLH and have not been validated in adults. Experimental studies suggest biomarkers to sufficiently diagnose HLH. However, biomarkers for the diagnosis of adult HLH have not yet been investigated.
The HEMICU (Diagnostic biomarkers for adult haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in critically ill patients) study aims to estimate the incidence rate of adult HLH among suspected adult patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Screening for HLH will be performed in 16 ICUs of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The inclusion criteria are bicytopaenia, hyperferritinaemia (≥500 µg/L), fever or when HLH is suspected by the clinician. Over a period of 2 years, we expect inclusion of about 100 patients with suspected HLH. HLH will be diagnosed if at least five of the HLH-2004 criteria are fulfilled, together with an expert review; all other included patients will serve as controls. Second, a panel of potential biomarker candidates will be explored. DNA, plasma and serum will be stored in a biobank. The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence rate of adult HLH among suspected adult patients during ICU stay. Out of a variety of measured biomarkers, this study furthermore aims to find highly potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of adult HLH in ICU. The results of this study will contribute to improved recognition and patient outcome of adult HLH in clinical routine.
The institutional ethics committee approved this study on 1 August 2018 (Ethics Committee of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, EA4/006/18). The results of the study will be disseminated in an international peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences.

Two decades of the Eurotransplant Senior Program: the gender gap in mortality impacts patient survival after kidney transplantation.	"Long-term outcomes of the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) are urgently needed to improve selection criteria and allocation policies in the elderly.
We analysed patient and allograft outcomes of 244 ESP-kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) between 1999 and 2019 and assessed quality of living compared with 82 ESP-waitlisted dialysis patients using standardized short form-8.
We observed 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival of 91.7, 66.3 and 38.0%, respectively. Mortality risk factors included male gender (P = 0.006) and T-cell-mediated rejection (P < 0.001). Median patient survival of male ESP-KTRs was 80 versus 131 months for female ESP-KTRs (P = 0.006). 1-, 5- and 10-year death-censored allograft survival was 93.3, 82.6 and 70.4%. Risk factors included high body mass index (P < 0.001) and T-cell-mediated rejection (P < 0.001). After re-initiation of dialysis median patient survival was 58 months. Change of estimated glomerular filtration rate showed a mean decline of 2.3 and 6.8 mL/min at 5 and 10 years. Median physical and mental component scores of ESP-KTRs were 40.2 and 48.3, significantly higher compared with dialysis patients (P < 0.05). Of ESP-KTRs, 97.5% who underwent transplantation would again do so.
Long-term outcomes of ESP-KTRs ultimately support the effectiveness of an age-matched allocation system. Our data suggest that the survival advantage of women is maintained after kidney transplantation and calls for gender-specific care."

Targeting CD20+ B-lymphocytes in inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy with rituximab improves clinical course: a case series.	"The aetiology of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is highly heterogeneous including genetic and/or acquired (infective, toxic, immune, endocrine, and nutritional) factors. The major part of acquired DCM in developed countries is caused by either viral or autoimmune myocarditis. It is believed that the activation of the T-lymphocyte cell system is the major pathomechanism underlying autoimmune myocarditis and inflammatory DCM (DCMi). However, in the hearts of a subset of patients, a significant number of CD20+ B-lymphocytes can be detected too. Limited information exists on the role of B-cell-dependent mechanisms in the progression of DCMi. Particularly CD20+ B-lymphocytes, which can be targeted by anti-CD20+ B-lymphocytes antibodies or inhibitors, might contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial damage beyond antibody production.
Here, we present a case series of six patients with subacute and chronic endomyocardial biopsy-proven CD20+ B-lymphocyte-associated DCMi, where symptomatic heart failure therapy, with or without combined immunosuppressive therapy with steroid-based treatment regime, was insufficient to improve cardiac function. Five patients improved clinically several weeks after a standard infusion protocol with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the pan-B-cell surface molecule CD20.
Our case series shows that CD20+ B-lymphocyte persistence can play a pathophysiologic role in a subset of DCMi patients and highlights the potential of targeting CD20+ B cells in patients with prominent CD20+ B-lymphocyte persistence."

Intensive blood pressure control is associated with improved patient and graft survival after renal transplantation.	Based on data of the SPRINT trial, American hypertension guidelines recently reduced the blood pressure goal from 140/90 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg for subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas European guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 130-139 mmHg. The present analysis investigates whether a SBP < 130 mmHg is associated with an additional benefit in renal transplant recipients. We performed a retrospective analysis of 815 renal transplant recipients who were stratified according to mean office SBP values < 130 mmHg, 130-139 mmHg or ≥140 mmHg. Patient and graft survival was defined as composite endpoint, follow-up was limited to 120 months. Mean SBP of the follow-up was significantly associated with the composite endpoint (n = 218) with better survival for a SBP < 130 mmHg and 130-139 mmHg compared to ≥140 mmHg (p < 0.001). The differences in the combined endpoint remained significant in Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, gender and eGFR (p = 0.007, HR = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.41-0.53), but not for graft survival alone. Renal transplant recipients with SBP < 130 mmHg had a lower mortality than those with the conservative blood pressure goal <140 mmHg. These data suggest that the new AHA BP targets are safe for renal transplant recipients and - with all limitations of a retrospective analysis - might even be associated with improved outcome.

VEGF - Supplemented extracellular matrix is sufficient to induce endothelial differentiation of human iPSC.	Extracellular matrix (ECM) provides a scaffold for cells and tissues, but also supports organogenesis and tissue remodeling. The required instructive properties of the ECM to interact with cells depend on matrix architecture, structural proteins and functional matrix components such as growth factors, providing spatial, chemical and functional cues. Decellularized ECM (dECM) has been proposed as an instructive material that promotes tissue regeneration. We investigated the instructive ECM elements preserved in dECM and necessary to promote endothelial differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). We show that detergent-decellularized human kidney ECM remains structurally intact and carries a number of heparin-binding growth factors, including FGF2, VEGF, BMP2, HGF, EGF, PDGF-BB and TGFβ, albeit at reduced levels compared to native tissues. Clearance of these heparin-binding factors, or heparan-sulfate proteoclycans from ECM resulted in massively reduced differentiation of hiPSC, suggesting that remaining structural dECM proteins such as laminin, collagen or fibronectin alone are not instructive. In contrast, replenishing dECM with VEGF replaced medium-supplemented VEGF and resulted in more efficient differentiation of hiPSC into endothelial cells, and even in the absence of other culture-supplemented differentiation factors dECM alone was superior to geltrex. In conclusion, conditioning of dECM with specific growth factors acting as functional cues may allow to generate functional niches by selective promotion of cell attachment, survival and differentiation.

Preformed Donor-Specific HLA Antibodies in Living and Deceased Donor Transplantation: A Multicenter Study.	"The prognostic value of preformed donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA), which are only detectable by sensitive methods, remains controversial for kidney transplantation.
The outcome of 4233 consecutive kidney transplants performed between 2012 and 2015 in 18 German transplant centers was evaluated. Most centers used a stepwise pretransplant antibody screening with bead array tests and differentiation of positive samples by single antigen assays. Using these screening results, DSA against HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 were determined. Data on clinical outcome and possible covariates were collected retrospectively.
Pretransplant DSA were associated with lower overall graft survival, with a hazard ratio of 2.53 for living donation (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.49 to 4.29; 
Preformed DSA were associated with an increased risk for graft loss in kidney transplantation, which was greater in living than in deceased donation. Even weak DSA <3000 MFI were associated with worse graft survival. This association was stronger in living than deceased donation."

Cytotoxic Effects of Rabbit Anti-thymocyte Globulin Preparations on Primary Human Thymic Epithelial Cells.	"Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) presents a major cause for morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Rabbit-derived antithymocyte globulin (rATG) treatment reduces the incidence of GvHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, delayed immune reconstitution following rATG treatment, partly caused by hampered thymic function, is being discussed. The present study aims at elucidating possible cytotoxic effects of 2 commonly used rATG preparations on cultured human thymic stroma, especially thymic epithelial cells (TECs).
A primary TEC culture was established and the binding and cytotoxicity of 2 rATG preparations to the aforementioned cells were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analyses. The release of several cytokines by cultured thymic stroma cells in response to rATG was analyzed via multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
Both preparations showed a comparable dose-dependent binding to TECs and exerted a similar complement-independent, dose-dependent cytotoxicity. rATG exposure further resulted in hampered secretion of interleukin (IL)-7, IL-15, and IL-6, cytokines being involved in thymic T cell development and proliferation. Pretreatment with keratinocyte growth factor diminished rATG-induced cytotoxicity of TECs and restored their IL-7 and IL-15 secretion.
Cytotoxic effects on TECs link the rATG-induced thymic damage to the delayed T cell reconstitution, witnessed after rATG treatment. Our data support a combination treatment of rATG and thymus-protective strategies such as keratinocyte growth factor to simultaneously offer sufficient GvHD prophylaxis and overcome delayed T cell reconstitution caused by thymic damage."

Comprehensive Characterization of a Next-Generation Antiviral T-Cell Product and Feasibility for Application in Immunosuppressed Transplant Patients.	Viral infections have a major impact on morbidity and mortality of immunosuppressed solid organ transplant (SOT) patients because of missing or failure of adequate pharmacologic antiviral treatment. Adoptive antiviral T-cell therapy (AVTT), regenerating disturbed endogenous T-cell immunity, emerged as an attractive alternative approach to combat severe viral complications in immunocompromised patients. AVTT is successful in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where T-cell products (TCPs) are manufactured from healthy donors. In contrast, in the SOT setting TCPs are derived from/applied back to immunosuppressed patients. We and others demonstrated feasibility of TCP generation from SOT patients and first clinical proof-of-concept trials revealing promising data. However, the initial efficacy is frequently lost long-term, because of limited survival of transferred short-lived T-cells indicating a need for next-generation TCPs. Our recent data suggest that Rapamycin treatment during TCP manufacture, conferring partial inhibition of mTOR, might improve its composition. The aim of this study was to confirm these promising observations in a setting closer to clinical challenges and to deeply characterize the next-generation TCPs. Using cytomegalovirus (CMV) as model, our next-generation Rapamycin-treated (Rapa-)TCP showed consistently increased proportions of CD4	Frontiers in immunology	2019-06-14	10.3389/fimmu.2019.01148	['Amini,L', 'Vollmer,T', 'Wendering,DJ', 'Jurisch,A', 'Landwehr-Kenzel,S', 'Otto,NM', 'Jürchott,K', 'Volk,HD', 'Reinke,P', 'Schmueck-Henneresse,M']	['Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nRenal and Transplant Research Unit, Department of Nephrology and Internal Intensive Care, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin-Brandenburg School for Regenerative Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin-Brandenburg School for Regenerative Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nDepartment for Pediatric Pulmonology, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Renal and Transplant Research Unit, Department of Nephrology and Internal Intensive Care, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Renal and Transplant Research Unit, Department of Nephrology and Internal Intensive Care, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Center for Advanced Therapies, Charité University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']
Effects of expanded allocation programmes and organ and recipient quality metrics on transplant-related costs in kidney transplantation - an institutional analysis.	Expansions of donor pools have a controversial impact on healthcare expenditures. The aim of this study was to investigate the emerging costs of expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidney transplantations (KT) and to identify independent risk factors for increased transplant-related costs. We present a retrospective explorative analysis of hospital costs and reimbursements of KTs performed between 2012 and 2016 in a German university hospital. A total of 174 KTs were examined, including 92 (52.9%) ECD organ transplantations. The ECD group comprised 43 (24.7%) 'old-for-old' transplantations. Median healthcare costs were 19 570€ (IQR 18 735-27 405€) in the standard criteria donor (SCD) group versus 25 478€ (IQR 19 957-29 634€) in the ECD group (+30%; P = 0.076). 'Old-for-old' transplantations showed the highest healthcare expenditures [26 702€ (19 570-33 940€)]. Irrespective of the allocation group, transplant-related costs increased significantly in obese (+6221€; P = 0.009) and elderly recipients (+6717€; P = 0.019), in warm ischaemia time exceeding 30 min (+3212€; P = 0.009) and in kidneys with DGF or surgical complications (+8976€ and +10 624€; both P < 0.001). Transplantation of ECD organs is associated with incremental costs, especially in elderly and obese recipients. A critical patient selection, treatment of obesity before KT and keeping warm ischaemia times short seem to be crucial, in order to achieve a cost-effective KT regardless of the allocation group.

An Advanced Murine Model for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis in Association with Type 2 Diabetes.	Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance, contributing to an increasing prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Recent research has established that pro-inflammatory immune cells infiltrate obese hypertrophic adipose tissue and liver. Given the emerging importance of immune cells in the context of metabolic homeostasis, there is a critical need to quantify and characterize their modification during the development of type 2 diabetes and NASH. However, animal models that induce pathophysiological features typical of human NASH are sparse. In this article, we provide a detailed protocol to identify immune cell subsets isolated from liver and adipose tissue in a reliable mouse model of NASH, established by housing high-fat diet (HFD) mice under non-specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions without a barrier for at least seven weeks. We demonstrate the handling of mice in non-SPF conditions, digestion of the tissues and identification of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, B and T cell subsets by flow cytometry. Representative flow cytometry plots from SPF HFD mice and non-SPF mice are provided. To obtain reliable and interpretable data, the use of antibodies, accurate and precise methods for tissue digestion and proper gating in flow cytometry experiments are critical elements. The intervention to restore physiological antigen exposure in mice by housing them in non-SPF conditions and unspecific exposure to microbial antigens could provide a relevant tool for investigating the link between immunological alterations, diet-induced obesity and related long term complications.

The Identity Card of T Cells-Clinical Utility of T-cell Receptor Repertoire Analysis in Transplantation.	"There is a clear medical need to change the current strategy of ""one-size-fits-all"" immunosuppression for controlling transplant rejection to precision medicine and targeted immune intervention. As T cells play a key role in both undesired graft rejection and protection, a better understanding of the fate and function of both alloreactive graft-deteriorating T cells and those protecting to infections is required. The T-cell receptor (TCR) is the individual identity card of each T cell clone and can help to follow single specificities. In this context, tracking of lymphocytes with certain specificity in blood and tissue in clinical follow up is of especial importance. After overcoming technical limitations of the past, novel molecular technologies opened new avenues of diagnostics. Using advantages of next generation sequencing, a method was established for T-cell tracing by detection of variable TCR region as identifiers of individual lymphocyte clones. The current review describes principles of laboratory and computational methods of TCR repertoire analysis, and gives an overview on applications for the basic understanding of transplant biology and immune monitoring. The review also delineates methodological pitfalls and challenges. With the outlook on prediction of antigens in immune-mediated processes including those of unknown causative pathogens, monitoring the fate and function of individual T cell clones, and the adoptive transfer of protective effector or regulatory T cells, this review highlights the current and future capability of TCR repertoire analysis."

Experience in the Adaptive Immunity Impacts Bone Homeostasis, Remodeling, and Healing.	Bone formation as well as bone healing capacity is known to be impaired in the elderly. Although bone formation is outpaced by bone resorption in aged individuals, we hereby present a novel path that considerably impacts bone formation and architecture: Bone formation is substantially reduced in aged individual owing to the experience of the adaptive immunity. Thus, immune-aging in addition to chronological aging is a potential risk factor, with an experienced immune system being recognized as more pro-inflammatory. The role of the aging immune system on bone homeostasis and on the bone healing cascade has so far not been considered. Within this study mice at different age and immunological experience were analyzed toward bone properties. Healing was assessed by introducing an osteotomy, immune cells were adoptively transferred to disclose the difference in biological vs. chronological aging.

A novel approach reveals that HLA class 1 single antigen bead-signatures provide a means of high-accuracy pre-transplant risk assessment of acute cellular rejection in renal transplantation.	"Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is associated with complications after kidney transplantation, such as graft dysfunction and graft loss. Early risk assessment is therefore critical for the improvement of transplantation outcomes. In this work, we retrospectively analyzed a pre-transplant HLA antigen bead assay data set that was acquired by the e:KID consortium as part of a systems medicine approach.
The data set included single antigen bead (SAB) reactivity profiles of 52 low-risk graft recipients (negative complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch, PRA < 30%) who showed detectable pre-transplant anti-HLA 1 antibodies. To assess whether the reactivity profiles provide a means for ACR risk assessment, we established a novel approach which differs from standard approaches in two aspects: the use of quantitative continuous data and the use of a multiparameter classification method. Remarkably, it achieved significant prediction of the 38 graft recipients who experienced ACR with a balanced accuracy of 82.7% (sensitivity = 76.5%, specificity = 88.9%).
The resultant classifier achieved one of the highest prediction accuracies in the literature for pre-transplant risk assessment of ACR. Importantly, it can facilitate risk assessment in non-sensitized patients who lack donor-specific antibodies.

Immune Modulation to Enhance Bone Healing-A New Concept to Induce Bone Using Prostacyclin to Locally Modulate Immunity.	Within an aging population, fracture incidences will rise and with the augmented risks of impaired healing the overall risk of delayed bone regeneration will substantially increase in elderly patients. Thus, new strategies to rescue fracture healing in the elderly are highly warranted. Modulating the initial inflammatory phase toward a reduced pro-inflammation launches new treatment options for delayed or impaired healing specifically in the elderly.

The Role of Pre-existing Cross-Reactive Central Memory CD4 T-Cells in Vaccination With Previously Unseen Influenza Strains.	Influenza vaccination is a common approach to prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza. Pre-existing antibodies against close viral strains might impair antibody formation against previously unseen strains-a process called original antigenic sin. The role of this pre-existing cellular immunity in this process is, despite some hints from animal models, not clear. Here, we analyzed cellular and humoral immunity in healthy individuals before and after vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine. Based on influenza-specific hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) titers, vaccinees were grouped into HI-negative and -positive cohorts followed by in-depth cytometric and TCR repertoire analysis. Both serological groups revealed cross-reactive T-cell memory to the vaccine strains at baseline that gave rise to the majority of vaccine-specific T-cells post vaccination. On the contrary, very limited number of vaccine-specific T-cell clones was recruited from the naive pool. Furthermore, baseline quantity of vaccine-specific central memory helper T-cells and clonotype richness of this population directly correlated with the vaccination efficacy. Our findings suggest that the deliberate recruitment of pre-existing cross-reactive cellular memory might help to improve vaccination outcome.

Generating Multiple Kidney Progenitors and Cell Types from Human Pluripotent Stem Cells.	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been well known for their ability to generate kidney cell types. We developed a protocol that utilizes a set of growth factors to give rise to kidney progenitors, which when differentiated further in a monolayer gives rise to podocyte precursors, mesangial cells, proximal and distal tubular epithelial cells, and collecting duct cells. This article describes in detail how to obtain each of these segment-specific kidney cell types from hPSCs. Once obtained as a homogenous population, these cells are invaluable for nephrotoxicity testing, for disease modeling, and in tissue engineering approaches such as 3D bioprinting and seeding on acellular matrices and scaffolds.

Intravascular Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cell Therapy Product Diversification: Time for New Clinical Guidelines.	Intravascular infusion is the most popular route for therapeutic multipotent mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) delivery in hundreds of clinical trials. Meta-analysis has demonstrated that bone marrow MSC infusion is safe. It is not clear if this also applies to diverse new cell products derived from other sources, such as adipose and perinatal tissues. Different MSC products display varying levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF) and may adversely trigger the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). Suitable strategies for assessing and controlling hemocompatibility and optimized cell delivery are crucial for the development of safer and more effective MSC therapies.

Circulating endothelial cells as biomarker for cardiovascular diseases.	"Endothelial dysfunction is involved in several cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and low levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been described in different cardiovascular conditions, suggesting their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction. Compared to typical peripheral blood leukocyte subsets, CECs and EPCs occur at very low frequency. The reliable identification and characterization of CECs and EPCs is a prerequisite for their clinical use, however, a validated method to this purpose is still missing but a key for rare cell events.
To establish a validated flow cytometric procedure in order to quantify CECs and EPCs in human whole blood.
In the establishment phase, the assay sensitivity, robustness, and the sample storage conditions were optimized as prerequisite for clinical use. In a second phase, CECs and EPCs were analyzed in heart failure with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced (HFrEF) ejection fraction, in arterial hypertension (aHT), and in diabetic nephropathy (DN) in comparison to age-matched healthy controls.
The quantification procedure for CECs and EPCs showed high sensitivity and reproducibility. CEC values resulted significantly increased in patients with DN and HFpEF in comparison to healthy controls. CEC quantification showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 90% and a sensitivity of 68.0%, 70.4%, and 66.7% for DN, HFpEF, and aHT, respectively.
A robust and precise assay to quantify CECs and EPCs in pre-clinical and clinical studies has been established. CEC counts resulted to be a good diagnostic biomarker for DN and HFpEF."

The IL-1 Pathway Is Hyperactive in Hidradenitis Suppurativa and Contributes to Skin Infiltration and Destruction.	Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) (also designated acne inversa) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by painful purulent skin lesions and progressive destruction of skin architecture. Despite the high burden for the patients, pathogenetic pathways underlying HS alterations remain obscure. When we examined the HS cytokine pattern, IL-1β turned out to be a highly prominent cytokine, overexpressed even compared with psoriatic lesions. Analyses of IL-1β-induced transcriptome in various cell types showed overlapping profiles, with upregulations of molecules causing immune cell infiltration and extracellular matrix degradation, and of specific cytokines including IL-6, IL-32, and IL-36. Matching cellular IL-1 receptor levels, dermal fibroblasts showed both the strongest and broadest IL-1β response, which was not clearly shared or strengthened by other cytokines. The IL-1β signature was specifically present in HS lesions and could be reversed by application of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Search for blood parameters associated with IL-1β pathway activity in HS identified serum amyloid A, which was synergistically induced by IL-1β and IL-6 in hepatocytes. Consequently, strongly elevated blood serum amyloid A levels in HS correlated positively with the extent of inflammatory skin alterations. In summary, the IL-1β pathway represents a pathogenetic cascade, whose activity may be therapeutically targeted and monitored by blood SAA levels.

Rescue from lethal acute radiation syndrome (ARS) with severe weight loss by secretome of intramuscularly injected human placental stromal cells.	"Most current cell-based regenerative therapies are based on the indirect induction of the affected tissues repair. Xenogeneic cell-based treatment with expanded human placenta stromal cells, predominantly from fetal origin (PLX-RAD cells), were shown to mitigate significantly acute radiation syndrome (ARS) following high dose irradiation in mice, with expedited regain of weight loss and haematopoietic function. The current mechanistic study explores the indirect effect of the secretome of PLX-RAD cells in the rescue of the irradiated mice.
The mitigation of the ARS was investigated following two intramuscularly (IM) injected 2 × 10
A 7.7 Gy whole body mice irradiation resulted in ~25% survival by 21 days. Treatment with two IM injections of 2 × 10
A well-regulated and orchestrated secretion of major pro-regenerative BM supporting secretome in high dose irradiated mice, treated with xenogeneic IM injected PLX-RAD cells, can explain the observed mitigation of ARS. This seemed to coincide with faster haematopoiesis regeneration, regain of severe weight loss and the increased survival rate. The ARS-related stress signals activating the IM injected PLX-RAD cells for the remote secretion of the relevant human proteins deserve further investigation."

Variants in exons 5 and 6 of ACTB cause syndromic thrombocytopenia.	Germline mutations in the ubiquitously expressed ACTB, which encodes β-cytoplasmic actin (CYA), are almost exclusively associated with Baraitser-Winter Cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF). Here, we report six patients with previously undescribed heterozygous variants clustered in the 3'-coding region of ACTB. Patients present with clinical features distinct from BWCFF, including mild developmental disability, microcephaly, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy. Using patient-derived fibroblasts, we demonstrate cohort specific changes to β-CYA filament populations, which include the enhanced recruitment of thrombocytopenia-associated actin binding proteins (ABPs). These perturbed interactions are supported by in silico modeling and are validated in disease-relevant thrombocytes. Co-examination of actin and microtubule cytoskeleton constituents in patient-derived megakaryocytes and thrombocytes indicates that these β-CYA mutations inhibit the final stages of platelet maturation by compromising microtubule organization. Our results define an ACTB-associated clinical syndrome with a distinct genotype-phenotype correlation and delineate molecular mechanisms underlying thrombocytopenia in this patient cohort.

Onset and progression of diabetes in kidney transplant patients receiving everolimus or cyclosporine therapy: an analysis of two randomized, multicenter trials.	"Conversion from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor following kidney transplantation may help to preserve graft function. Data are sparse, however, concerning the impact of conversion on posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) or the progression of pre-existing diabetes.
PTDM and other diabetes-related parameters were assessed post hoc in two large open-label multicenter trials. Kidney transplant recipients were randomized (i) at month 4.5 to switch to everolimus or remain on a standard cyclosporine (CsA)-based regimen (ZEUS, n = 300), or (ii) at month 3 to switch to everolimus, remain on standard CNI therapy or convert to everolimus with reduced-exposure CsA (HERAKLES, n = 497).
There were no significant differences in the incidence of PTDM between treatment groups (log rank p = 0.97 [ZEUS], p = 0.90 [HERAKLES]). The mean change in random blood glucose from randomization to month 12 was also similar between treatment groups in both trials for patients with or without PTDM, and with or without pre-existing diabetes. The change in eGFR from randomization to month 12 showed a benefit for everolimus versus comparator groups in all subpopulations, but only reached significance in larger subgroups (no PTDM or no pre-existing diabetes).
Within the restrictions of this post hoc analysis, including non-standardized diagnostic criteria and limited glycemia laboratory parameters, these data do not indicate any difference in the incidence or severity of PTDM with early conversion from a CsA-based regimen to everolimus, or in the progression of pre-existing diabetes.

Immunomodulatory placental-expanded, mesenchymal stromal cells improve muscle function following hip arthroplasty.	"No regenerative approach has thus far been shown to be effective in skeletal muscle injuries, despite their high frequency and associated functional deficits. We sought to address surgical trauma-related muscle injuries using local intraoperative application of allogeneic placenta-derived, mesenchymal-like adherent cells (PLX-PAD), using hip arthroplasty as a standardized injury model, because of the high regenerative and immunomodulatory potency of this cell type.
Our pilot phase I/IIa study was prospective, randomized, double blind, and placebo-controlled. Twenty patients undergoing hip arthroplasty via a direct lateral approach received an injection of 3.0 × 10
We did not observe any relevant PLX-PAD-related adverse events at the 2-year follow-up. Improved gluteus medius strength was noted as early as Week 6 in the treatment-groups. Surprisingly, until Week 26, the low-dose group outperformed the high-dose group and reached significantly improved strength compared with placebo [150 M vs. placebo: P = 0.007 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 7.6, 43.9); preoperative baseline values mean ± SE: placebo: 24.4 ± 6.7 Nm, 150 M: 27.3 ± 5.6 Nm], mirrored by an increase in muscle volume [150 M vs. placebo: P = 0.004 (baseline adjusted; 95% confidence interval 6.0, 30.0); preoperative baseline values GM volume: placebo: 211.9 ± 15.3 cm

In situ detection of CD73+ CD90+ CD105+ lineage: Mesenchymal stromal cells in human placenta and bone marrow specimens by chipcytometry.	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) support endogenous regeneration and present therefore promising opportunities for in situ tissue engineering. They can be isolated and expanded from various tissues, for example, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or placenta. The minimal consensus definition criteria of ex vivo expanded MSCs requires them to be positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105 expression, while being negative for CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19, and HLA-DR. This study aimed to compare the in situ phenotype of MSCs with that of their culture-expanded progeny. We report for the first time in situ detection of cells expressing this marker combination in human placenta cryosections as well as in bone marrow aspirates using multiplex-immunohistology (Chipcytometry), a technique that allows staining of more than 100 biomarkers consecutively on the same cell. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

BKV, CMV, and EBV Interactions and their Effect on Graft Function One Year Post-Renal Transplantation: Results from a Large Multi-Centre Study.	"BK virus (BKV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivations are common after kidney transplantation and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although CMV might be a risk factor for BKV and EBV, the effects of combined reactivations remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the interaction and effects on graft function of these reactivations.
3715 serum samples from 540 kidney transplant recipients were analysed for viral load by qPCR. Measurements were performed throughout eight visits during the first post-transplantation year. Clinical characteristics, including graft function (GFR), were collected in parallel.
BKV had the highest prevalence and viral loads. BKV or CMV viral loads over 10,000 copies·mL
BKV-CMV combined reactivation has a deep impact on renal function one year post-transplantation and therefore most likely on long-term allograft function, even at low viral loads. Frequent viral monitoring and subsequent interventions for low BKV and/or CMV viraemia levels and/or long cold ischaemia time are recommended.

Histological findings to five years after early conversion of kidney transplant patients from cyclosporine to everolimus: an analysis from the randomized ZEUS study.	"Conversion from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to everolimus within 6 months after kidney transplantation improves long-term graft function but can increase the risk of mild biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (BPAR). We performed a post-hoc analysis of histological data from a randomized trial in order to further analyze histologic information obtained from indication and protocol biopsies up to 5 years after transplantation.
Biopsy samples obtained up to 5 years post-transplant were analyzed from the randomized ZEUS study, in which kidney transplant patients were randomized at month 4.5 to switch to everolimus (n = 154) or remain on cyclosporine (CsA)-based immunosuppression (n = 146). All patients received mycophenolate and steroids.
At least one investigator-initiated biopsy was undertaken in 53 patients in each group between randomization and year 5, with a mean (SD) of 2.6 (1.7) and 2.2 (1.4) biopsies per patient in the everolimus and CsA groups, respectively. In the everolimus and CsA groups, investigator-initiated biopsies showed (i) BPAR in 12.3 and 7.5% (p = 0.182) of patients, respectively, with episodes graded mild in 22/24 and 18/20 cases (ii) CsA toxicity lesions in 4.5 and 10.3% of patients (p = 0.076) (iii) antibody-mediated rejection in 0.6 and 2.7% of patients (p = 0.204), respectively.
This analysis of histological findings in the ZEUS study to 5 years after kidney transplantation shows no increase in antibody-mediated rejection under everolimus-based therapy with a lower rate of CNI-related toxicity compared to a conventional CsA-based regimen, and confirms the preponderance of mild BPAR seen in the main study after the early switch to CsA-free everolimus therapy.

However, our knowledge is mostly based on conventional murine models and promising preclinical studies rarely translated into successful therapies. There is a growing awareness of the limitations of studies in laboratory mice, housed in abnormally hygienic specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, as relevant aspects of the human immune system remain unappreciated. Here, we assessed the impact of housing conditions on adaptive immunity and metabolic disease processes during high-fat diet (HFD). We therefore compared diet-induced obesity in SPF mice with those housed in non-SPF, so-called ""antigen exposed"" (AE) conditions. Surprisingly, AE mice fed a HFD maintained increased insulin levels to compensate for insulin resistance, which was reflected in islet hyperplasia and improved glucose tolerance compared to SPF mice. By contrast, we observed higher proportions of effector/memory T cell subsets in blood and liver of HFD AE mice accompanied by the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-like liver pathology. Thus, our data demonstrate the impact of housing conditions on metabolic alterations. Studies in AE mice, in which physiological microbial exposure was restored, could provide a tool for revealing therapeutic targets for immune-based interventions for T2D patients."

Cyclosporine use and male gender are independent determinants of avascular necrosis after kidney transplantation: a cohort study.	"Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at increased risk of avascular necrosis (AVN) due to bone disorder, steroid use and common comorbidities. However, knowledge on risk factors and outcomes of AVN among KTRs in the modern era of immunosuppression remains scarce.
We analysed 765 KTRs between 2001 and 2013 for AVN. Cases of symptomatic AVN were diagnosed by hip X-ray, radioisotope bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated risk factors and clinical characteristics of AVN.
KTRs showed a constant incidence rate of AVN of 4.1% at 10 years after transplantation. The use of cyclosporine compared with tacrolimus was identified as an independent risk factor, with a rate of 8.0% compared with 2.7% at 10 years (P < 0.01). In addition, male gender was independently associated with AVN (P = 0.047). Eighty-three per cent of AVN cases were of the femoral head and treated operatively. None of the operated KTRs experienced complications in the long term. Thirty-three per cent of KTRs had bilateral AVN. Ninety-two per cent of KTRs showed AVN at the allograft side.
The decreasing incidence of AVN may be attributed to the replacement of cyclosporine by tacrolimus over the last decade. Our data raise the hypothesis of an ischaemic steal syndrome due to the allograft kidney impacting AVN at the allograft side."

Ex vivo expanded natural regulatory T cells from patients with end-stage renal disease or kidney transplantation are useful for autologous cell therapy.	Novel concepts employing autologous, ex vivo expanded natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) for adoptive transfer has potential to prevent organ rejection after kidney transplantation. However, the impact of dialysis and maintenance immunosuppression on the nTreg phenotype and peripheral survival is not well understood, but essential when assessing patient eligibility. The current study investigates regulatory T-cells in dialysis and kidney transplanted patients and the feasibility of generating a clinically useful nTreg product from these patients. Heparinized blood from 200 individuals including healthy controls, dialysis patients with end stage renal disease and patients 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 years after kidney transplantation were analyzed. Differentiation and maturation of nTregs were studied by flow cytometry in order to compare dialysis patients and kidney transplanted patients under maintenance immunosuppression to healthy controls.

Immunosuppression Is Associated With Clinical Features and Relapse Risk of B Cell Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder: A Retrospective Analysis Based on the Prospective, International, Multicenter PTLD-1 Trials.	"Current guideline recommendations for immunosuppression reduction after diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) include stopping antimetabolites, reducing calcineurin inhibitors, and maintaining corticosteroids. However, the effect of immunosuppression on PTLD relapse risk after up-to-date therapy is unclear.
This is a retrospective analysis of immunosuppression, patient baseline characteristics, and relapse risk measured as landmark time to progression (TTP) starting 1 year after start of therapy in 159 patients with B cell PTLD after solid organ transplantation treated in the prospective, international, multicenter PTLD-1 trials with either sequential treatment (rituximab followed by cyclophosphamide (CHOP-21 chemotherapy) 750 mg/m intravenously [IV] day (d) 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m IV d1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m (maximum, 2 mg) IV d1, and prednisone 50 mg/m PO d1-5, every 21 days) or risk-stratified sequential treatment (rituximab followed by rituximab or rituximab (R-CHOP-21 immunochemotherapy) 375 mg/m IV day (d) 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m IV d1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m IV d1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m (max. 2 mg) IV d1, and prednisone 50 mg/m PO d1-5, every 21 days).
Patient baseline characteristics at diagnosis of PTLD differed significantly depending on immunosuppression before diagnosis. Compared with immunosuppression before diagnosis, significantly fewer patients received an antimetabolite or a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) after diagnosis of PTLD. Relapse risk measured as landmark TTP was significantly higher for patients on corticosteroids compared to all others (P = 0.010) as well as for patients on ciclosporin compared with those on tacrolimus (P = 0.002), but similar for those on antimetabolites compared with all others (P = 0.912). In a Cox regression analysis of landmark TTP, corticosteroid-containing immunosuppression after diagnosis of PTLD (P = 0.002; hazard ratio, 11.195) and age (P = 0.001; hazard ratio, 1.076/year) were identified as independent, significant risk factors for PTLD relapse.
In the prospective PTLD-1 trials, corticosteroid use after diagnosis of PTLD is associated with an increased risk of relapse, whereas the use of antimetabolites is not. These findings require prospective validation."

Differential T cell response against BK virus regulatory and structural antigens: A viral dynamics modelling approach.	BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1-10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.

Immunoadsorption to remove ß2 adrenergic receptor antibodies in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome CFS/ME.	"Infection-triggered disease onset, chronic immune activation and autonomic dysregulation in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) point to an autoimmune disease directed against neurotransmitter receptors. We had observed elevated autoantibodies against ß2 adrenergic receptors, and muscarinic 3 and 4 acetylcholine receptors in a subset of patients. Immunoadsorption (IA) was shown to be effective in removing autoantibodies and improve outcome in various autoimmune diseases.
10 patients with post-infectious CFS/ME and elevated ß2 autoantibodies were treated with IA with an IgG-binding column for 5 days. We assessed severity of symptoms as outcome parameter by disease specific scores. Antibodies were determined by ELISA and B cell phenotype by flow cytometry.
IgG levels dropped to median 0.73 g/l (normal 7-16 g/l) after the 4th cycle of IA, while IgA and IgM levels remained unchanged. Similarly, elevated ß2 IgG antibodies rapidly decreased during IA in 9 of 10 patients. Also 6 months later ß2 autoantibodies were significantly lower compared to pretreatment. Frequency of memory B cells significantly decreased and frequency of plasma cells increased after the 4th IA cycle. A rapid improvement of symptoms was reported by 7 patients during the IA. 3 of these patients had long lasting moderate to marked improvement for 6-12+ months, 2 patients had short improvement only and 2 patients improved for several months following initial worsening.
IA can remove autoantibodies against ß2 adrenergic receptor and lead to clinical improvement. B cell phenotyping provides evidence for an effect of IA on memory B cell development.

Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of Chronic Hepatitis E Infection in German Renal Transplant Recipients With Elevated Liver Enzymes.	"Elevated liver enzymes are frequently observed in renal transplant recipients and warrant further exploration. In immunosuppressed patients, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and extrahepatic manifestations such as renal injury.
We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study investigating the prevalence, clinical correlates, and outcome of chronic HEV infection in a cohort of renal transplant recipients with elevated liver enzymes.
Over a period of 30 months, 140 of 1469 renal transplant recipients had elevated liver enzymes, of which serum samples from 98 patients were available to determine HEV status. Seventeen patients were detected with HEV infection, of which 16 developed chronic HEV infection, while 1 patient controlled viremia (prevalence of chronic infection of 16.3%, with a minimum prevalence of 1.1% in the whole cohort). Increased liver stiffness was indicated by an average FibroScan result of 11.2 kPa in these patients. All 16 patients with chronic HEV infection were treated with ribavirin for a mean duration of 3 months. Five patients developed a viral rebound and received a second treatment course, of which 2 controlled HEV replication. Six months after the end of therapy, HEV clearance was achieved in 81.3% of the patients. One patient developed ribavirin resistance. Hemolytic anemia after ribavirin treatment was frequent, requiring blood transfusion in 3 patients. Four patients developed de novo glomerulonephritis, of which 2 were possibly associated with HEV infection.
This retrospective study showed that prevalence of chronic HEV infection was high in our renal transplant patient cohort and was associated with significant liver impairment and the occurrence of renal injury. Ribavirin treatment was effective and should be initiated early to avoid complications, but the risk of severe hemolytic anemia makes strict monitoring essential."

We studied 111 KTRs who underwent their second kidney transplantation from 1998 to 2015. In 51/111 KTRs (46%) the failed allograft was removed and in 60/111 (54%) the failed allograft was retained. KTRs with primary non-function and allograft loss <12  months of the first failed allograft were excluded from analysis. Samples were collected before transplantation and at  1  month posttransplantation and donor-reactive T cells were measured using an interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay.
KTRs with the previous allograft removed showed significantly higher rates of acute cellular rejection compared with KTRs with the previous allograft retained [27/51 KTRs (53%) versus 18/60 KTRs (30%); P = 0.019]. KTRs with the previous allograft removed showed significantly inferior death-censored allograft survival compared with KTRs with the previous allograft retained (P = 0.022). Here, KTRs with the previous allograft removed showed significantly higher donor-reactive T cells pretransplantation compared with KTRs with the previous allograft retained (P = 0.012). Interestingly, no differences were observed for the presence of panel reactive antibodies and for the development of de novo donor-specific antibodies.
Our data suggest higher cellular presensitization among KTRs with the previous allograft removed, which is associated with higher rates of acute cellular rejection and inferior allograft survival. Immunological mechanisms that may account for these differences may include prolonged maintenance immunosuppression to save urine output in KTRs with the first kidney allograft retained and cellular presensitization after withdrawal of maintenance immunosuppression, which lead to allograft rejection and ultimately to allograft nephrectomy."

Personalized risk prediction of postoperative cognitive impairment - rationale for the EU-funded BioCog project.	Postoperative cognitive impairment is among the most common medical complications associated with surgical interventions - particularly in elderly patients. In our aging society, it is an urgent medical need to determine preoperative individual risk prediction to allow more accurate cost-benefit decisions prior to elective surgeries. So far, risk prediction is mainly based on clinical parameters. However, these parameters only give a rough estimate of the individual risk. At present, there are no molecular or neuroimaging biomarkers available to improve risk prediction and little is known about the etiology and pathophysiology of this clinical condition. In this short review, we summarize the current state of knowledge and briefly present the recently started BioCog project (Biomarker Development for Postoperative Cognitive Impairment in the Elderly), which is funded by the European Union. It is the goal of this research and development (R&D) project, which involves academic and industry partners throughout Europe, to deliver a multivariate algorithm based on clinical assessments as well as molecular and neuroimaging biomarkers to overcome the currently unsatisfying situation.

Factors and outcomes in association with sepsis differ between simultaneous pancreas/kidney and single kidney transplant recipients.	"As immunosuppressive therapy has improved in simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant recipients (SPKTRs), infection has become the major limitation of disease-free survival.
We studied all SPKTRs and deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) between 2003 and 2015. Thirty-six of 134 SPKTRs (26.9%) were diagnosed with sepsis among which 13/36 SPKTRs (36.1%) developed severe sepsis/septic shock. A control group of 98 SPKTRs without sepsis and 61/538 KTRs (11.3%) with sepsis were used for comparison.
Among SPKTRs, female sex, low BMI, CMV seronegativity, CMV disease, and acute cellular rejection increased the risk for sepsis (P < .05). Patient and allograft survival was comparable among SPKTRs with and without sepsis (P > .05), but showed inferior kidney allograft function (P < .05). While urosepsis was less common among SPKTRs (45%), pneumonia (33%) and peritonitis (15%) as site of infections were more frequent (P < .05). Here, gram-positive and fungal sepsis were more common among SPKTRs compared to KTRs (P < .05). SPKTRs showed a higher incidence and an earlier onset of sepsis compared to KTRs (P < .001). SPKTRs with severe sepsis/septic shock were more likely to show pneumonia as site of infection with gram-positive/polymicrobial bacteremia (P < .05). Mortality from severe sepsis was 29% among SPKTRs compared to 58% among KTRs (P < .05).
Differences in incidence, site, causative pathogens, and onset of sepsis between SPKTRs and KTRs may be attributed to more intense immunosuppression, major surgery, and complications of diabetes among SPKTRs. Lower sepsis-related mortality may reflect younger age and more timely diagnosis, but also supports recent findings of less sepsis-related mortality among recipients of solid organ transplantation."

The effect of induction therapy on established CMV specific T cell immunity in living donor kidney transplantation.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection influences both short and long term outcomes in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different induction immunosuppression regimens on CMV specific T cell response in patients with already established CMV immunity. In 24 seropositive living donor kidney recipients, the frequency of CMV specific T cells was determined by ELISPOT (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot) assay prior and 6 months after transplantation. Recipients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with immediate-early (IE1) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) CMV-derived peptide pools and the number of cells producing interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was assessed. Patients received quadruple immunosuppression based either on depletive rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) or non-depletive basiliximab induction and tacrolimus/mycophenolate mofetil/steroids. Patients with rATG induction received valgancyclovir prophylaxis. No effects of different induction agents on CMV specific T cell immunity were found at sixth month after kidney transplantation. There were no associations among dialysis vintage, pretransplant CMV specific T cell immunity, and later CMV DNAemia. Similarly, no effect of CMV prophylaxis on CMV specific T cell immunity was revealed. This study shows no effect of posttransplant immunosuppression on CMV specific T cell immunity in living donor kidney transplant recipients with CMV immunity already established, regardless of lymphocyte depletion and CMV prophylaxis.

End-of-Treatment Positron Emission Tomography After Uniform First-Line Therapy of B-Cell Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder Identifies Patients at Low Risk of Relapse in the Prospective German PTLD Registry.	"Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is a recommended standard in the staging and response assessment of 18F-FDG-avid lymphoma. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) can be detected by 18F-FDG-PET at diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. However, the role of response assessment by end-of-treatment (EOT) PET has only been addressed in small case series.
We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of 37 patients with CD20-positive PTLD after solid organ transplantation treated with uniform, up-to-date, first-line protocols in the prospective German PTLD registry who had received EOT 18F-FDG-PET between 2006 and 2014. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. Any nonphysiological 18F-FDG uptake (Deauville score greater 2) was interpreted as PET-positive.
By computed tomography (CT) final staging, 18 of 37 patients had a complete response, 18 had a partial response and 1 patient had stable disease. EOT PET was negative in 24 of 37 patients and positive in 13 of 37 patients. The positive predictive value of EOT PET for PTLD relapse was 38%, and the negative predictive value was 92%. Time to progression (TTP) and progression-free-survival were significantly longer in the PET negative group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.013). In the 18 patients in a partial response by CT staging, we noted highly significant differences in overall survival (P = 0.001), time to progression (P = 0.007), and progression-free survival (P < 0.001) by EOT PET.
Even without baseline imaging, EOT PET in PTLD identifies patients at low risk of relapse and offers clinically relevant information, particularly in patients in a partial remission by CT staging."

Valganciclovir Prophylaxis Versus Preemptive Therapy in Cytomegalovirus-Positive Renal Allograft Recipients: Long-term Results After 7 Years of a Randomized Clinical Trial.	"The VIPP study compared valganciclovir prophylaxis with preemptive treatment regarding efficacy, safety, and long-term graft outcome in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive (R+) renal transplant recipients.
Multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical study with a 12-month study phase and a follow-up of up to 84 months. Patients in the prophylaxis group received 2 × 450 mg/d oral valganciclovir for 100 days adjusted to renal function. Preemptive treatment with 2 × 900 mg/d valganciclovir was initiated at a viral load of 400 CMV copies/mL or greater (polymerase chain reaction) and maintained over ≥14 days, followed by secondary prophylaxis. Patients were stratified by donor CMV IgG serostatus (donor CMV IgG positive [D+]/R+, donor CMV IgG negative [D-]/R+).
The 12-month results were reported previously (Witzke et al Transplantation 2012). The intent-to-treat/safety population comprised 148 patients in the prophylaxis (61.5% D+/R+) and 151 patients in the preemptive group (52.3% D+/R+). Overall, 47% patients completed the follow-up. Significantly fewer patients in the prophylaxis compared with preemptive group experienced a CMV infection or disease up to month 84 (11.5%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.8-17.8%] vs 39.7%; 95% CI, 31.9-48.0%; P < 0.0001 and 4.7%; 95% CI, 1.9-9.5% vs 15.9%; 95% CI, 10.5-22.7%; P = 0.002). Incidences of graft loss (7.4% vs 8.6%), death (9.5% vs 11.3%), rejection (29.1% vs 28.5%), and renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [mean ± SD]: 58.2 ± 26.3 vs 59.9 ± 25.7 mL/min per 1.73 m) were not significantly different between prophylaxis and preemptive treatment. Tolerability was comparable between groups.
Prophylaxis was more effective than the preemptive approach, applying a low-intense surveillance protocol in preventing CMV infection and disease in intermediate-risk patients. Both strategies were similarly effective in preventing graft loss and death under the conditions of this long-term trial with a threshold of 400 copies/mL for initiation of anti-CMV treatment."

Pink-beam serial crystallography.	"Serial X-ray crystallography allows macromolecular structure determination at both X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) and, more recently, synchrotron sources. The time resolution for serial synchrotron crystallography experiments has been limited to millisecond timescales with monochromatic beams. The polychromatic, ""pink"", beam provides a more than two orders of magnitude increased photon flux and hence allows accessing much shorter timescales in diffraction experiments at synchrotron sources. Here we report the structure determination of two different protein samples by merging pink-beam diffraction patterns from many crystals, each collected with a single 100 ps X-ray pulse exposure per crystal using a setup optimized for very low scattering background. In contrast to experiments with monochromatic radiation, data from only 50 crystals were required to obtain complete datasets. The high quality of the diffraction data highlights the potential of this method for studying irreversible reactions at sub-microsecond timescales using high-brightness X-ray facilities."

Influenza Vaccination in Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID).	"Vaccination against influenza in patients with primary antibody deficiency is recommended. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most frequent and clinically relevant antibody deficiency disease and is by definition characterized by an impaired vaccination response. The purpose of this review is to present the current knowledge of humoral and cellular vaccine response to influenza in CVID patients.
Studies conducted in CVID patients demonstrated an impaired humoral response upon influenza vaccination. Data on cellular immune response are in part conflicting, with two out of three studies showing responses similar to healthy controls. Available data suggest a benefit from influenza vaccination in CVID patients. Therefore, annual influenza vaccination in patients and their close household contacts is recommended."

Human Parvovirus B19 (B19V) Up-regulates CXCR4 Surface Expression of Circulating Angiogenic Cells: Implications for Cardiac Ischemia in B19V Cardiomyopathy.	"Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection and damage of circulating angiogenic cells (CAC) results in dysfunctional endogenous vascular repair (DEVR) with secondary end-organ damage. Trafficking of CAC is regulated by SDF-1α and the respective receptor CXCR4. We thus tested the hypothesis of a deregulated CXCR4/SDF-1α axis in symptomatic B19V-cardiomyopathy.
CAC were infected in vitro with B19V and transfected with B19V-components. Read-out were: CXCR4-expression and migratory capacity at increasing doses of SDF-1α. In 31 patients with chronic B19V-cardiomyopathy compared to 20 controls read-outs were from blood: migratory capacity, CXCR4 expression on CAC, serum SDF-1α; from cardiac biopsies: SDF-1α mRNA, HIF-1α mRNA, microvascular density, resident cardiac stem cells (CSC), transcardiac gradients of CAC.
In vitro B19V-infected CAC showed up-regulation of surface CXCR4 with increased migratory capacity further enhanced by elevated SDF-1α concentrations. Overexpression of the B19V capsid protein VP2 was associated with this effect. Chronic B19V-cardiomyopathy patients showed increased numbers of ischaemia mobilised CAC but DEVR as well as diminished numbers of CAC after transcardiac passage. Cardiac microvascular density and CSC were significantly reduced in B19V-cardiomyopathy.
We thus conclude that B19V infection has a direct VP2-mediated negative impact on trafficking of CAC in the presence of impaired cardiac regeneration."

Estimated Nephron Number of the Donor Kidney: Impact on Allograft Kidney Outcomes.	"Low birth weights have been associated with a reduction in nephron number with compensatory hypertrophy of existing glomeruli. The impact of donor birth weight as an estimate of nephron number on allograft function, however, has not been examined.
We collected donor birth weight, kidney weight, and volume from 91 living kidney donor-recipient pairs before nephrectomy and after 12, 36, and 60 months. Nephron number was calculated from donor birth weight and age.
Donor birth weight, kidney weight/body surface area (BSA), and kidney volume showed a moderate positive correlation with allograft estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 12 months (P < .05). Donor age showed a negative moderate correlation with allograft eGFR at 12 months (P = .015). The strongest correlation with allograft eGFR was observed for calculated donor kidney nephron number at 12, 36, and 60 months (R, 0.340, 0.305, and 0.476, respectively; P < .05). No impact was observed on allograft daily proteinuria of any investigated marker (P > .05). Recipients of donors with birth weight <2.5 kg had need of a significantly greater number of antihypertensive drugs (P < .05).
Calculated nephron number from donor birth weight and age is suggested to be superior to donor kidney weight/BSA and volume regarding allograft function. Calculated nephron number could estimate expected eGFR and guide decision making in cases of impaired allograft function."

Simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant recipients are predisposed to tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease and concomitant infectious complications.	"Infections have increased in simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant recipients (SPKTRs) with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection being the most important viral infection with adverse impact on patient and allograft outcomes.
We studied all primary SPKTRs and deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) between 2008 and 2015 for the development of CMV infection. A total of 21/62 SPKTRs (33.9%) and 90/335 KTRs (26.9%) were diagnosed with CMV infection. A control group of 41 SPKTRs without CMV infection was used for comparison.
SPKTRs showed an increased incidence of CMV infection compared with KTRs. SPKTRs were more likely to develop CMV disease, CMV pneumonia, recurrent CMV infection, higher initial and peak CMV loads, and more need for intravenous antiviral therapy compared with KTRs (P<.05). High-risk CMV serostatus (D+R-) and 2 HLA-B/-DR mismatches increased the risk of CMV infection in SPKTRs (P<.05). No differences were observed for patient and allograft outcomes (P>.05). SPKTRs with CMV infection were more likely to show concomitant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia compared with SPKTRs without CMV infection (P<.05). SPKTRs with CMV infection showed higher incidences of concomitant BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, EBV viremia, and sepsis compared with KTRs with CMV infection (P<.05).
Our results suggest a higher incidence and more severe course of CMV infection in SPKTRs compared with KTRs. The increased incidence of concomitant infectious complications among SPKTRs with CMV infection suggests an overall impaired immunity, and calls for more intense screening."

Donor-Recipient Matching Based on Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes Independently Predicts the Incidence of De Novo Donor-Specific HLA Antibodies Following Renal Transplantation.	De novo donor-specific HLA antibodies (dnDSA) are recognized as a risk factor for premature allograft failure. Determinants of DSA specificity are generated via the indirect allorecognition pathway. Here, we present supportive data for the relevance of predicted indirectly recognizable HLA epitopes (PIRCHE) to predict dnDSA following kidney transplantation. A total of 2787 consecutive kidney transplants performed between 1995 and 2015 without preformed DSA have been analyzed. De novo DSA were detected by single antigen bead assay. HLA epitope mismatches were determined by the HLAMatchmaker and PIRCHE approach and correlated in uni- and multivariate analyses with 10-year allograft survival and incidence of dnDSA. The PIRCHE-II score moderately predicted allograft survival. However, the predictive value of elevated PIRCHE-II scores >9 for the incidence of dnDSA was statistically significant (p < 0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for antigen mismatch and HLAMatchmaker epitopes, the PIRCHE-II score could be identified as an independent risk factor for dnDSA. The PIRCHE-II score independently from the antigen mismatch and HLAMatchmaker epitopes could be revealed as being a strong predictor for dnDSA. PIRCHE may help to identify acceptable mismatches with decreased risk of dnDSA and thus improve long-term renal allograft survival.

Everolimus with cyclosporine withdrawal or low-exposure cyclosporine in kidney transplantation from Month 3: a multicentre, randomized trial.	"Randomized trials have shown that early adoption of everolimus-based immunosuppressive regimens without a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) improves long-term kidney graft function, but the optimal strategy for CNI minimization remains uncertain.
In a prospective, randomized, multicentre, 12-month trial, 499 de novo kidney transplant patients were randomized at Month 3 to (i) remain on standard CNI (cyclosporine) therapy with mycophenolic acid, (ii) convert to everolimus with mycophenolic acid or (iii) start everolimus with reduced CNI and no mycophenolic acid (clinical trials registry: ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT00514514).
The primary endpoint, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Nankivell) from randomization to Month 12, was significantly greater in the CNI-free arm versus standard CNI therapy: mean difference 5.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-8.3 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , P < 0.001]. The improvement in eGFR in the CNI-free arm was also higher than in the low-CNI group (mean difference 5.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 95% CI 2.8-8.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , P < 0.001), while results were similar in the low-CNI and standard CNI arms. The post-randomization incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection was 11.7%, 8.1% and 7.9% in the CNI-free, low-CNI and standard CNI groups, respectively (CNI-free versus standard CNI, P = 0.27; low-CNI versus standard CNI, P = 1.00). Adverse events led to study drug discontinuation in 28.7%, 15.5% and 15.2% of CNI-free, low-CNI and standard CNI patients, respectively.

Serological profiling of the EBV immune response in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome using a peptide microarray.	"Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) plays an important role as trigger or cofactor for various autoimmune diseases. In a subset of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) disease starts with infectious mononucleosis as late primary EBV-infection, whereby altered levels of EBV-specific antibodies can be observed in another subset of patients.
We performed a comprehensive mapping of the IgG response against EBV comparing 50 healthy controls with 92 CFS patients using a microarray platform. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cancer-related fatigue served as controls. 3054 overlapping peptides were synthesised as 15-mers from 14 different EBV proteins. Array data was validated by ELISA for selected peptides. Prevalence of EBV serotypes was determined by qPCR from throat washing samples.
EBV type 1 infections were found in patients and controls. EBV seroarray profiles between healthy controls and CFS were less divergent than that observed for MS or SLE. We found significantly enhanced IgG responses to several EBNA-6 peptides containing a repeat sequence in CFS patients compared to controls. EBNA-6 peptide IgG responses correlated well with EBNA-6 protein responses. The EBNA-6 repeat region showed sequence homologies to various human proteins.
Patients with CFS had a quite similar EBV IgG antibody response pattern as healthy controls. Enhanced IgG reactivity against an EBNA-6 repeat sequence and against EBNA-6 protein is found in CFS patients. Homologous sequences of various human proteins with this EBNA-6 repeat sequence might be potential targets for antigenic mimicry."

T Lymphocytes Influence the Mineralization Process of Bone.	Bone is a unique organ able to regenerate itself after injuries. This regeneration requires the local interplay between different biological systems such as inflammation and matrix formation. Structural reconstitution is initiated by an inflammatory response orchestrated by the host immune system. However, the individual role of T cells and B cells in regeneration and their relationship to bone tissue reconstitution remain unknown. Comparing bone and fracture healing in animals with and without mature T and B cells revealed the essential role of these immune cells in determining the tissue mineralization and thus the bone quality. Bone without mature T and B cells is stiffer when compared to wild-type bone thus lacking the elasticity that helps to absorb forces, thus preventing fractures. In-depth analysis showed dysregulations in collagen deposition and osteoblast distribution upon lack of mature T and B cells. These changes in matrix deposition have been correlated with T cells rather than B cells within this study. This work presents, for the first time, a direct link between immune cells and matrix formation during bone healing after fracture. It illustrates specifically the role of T cells in the collagen organization process and the lack thereof in the absence of T cells.

CMV-Specific T Cell Monitoring Offers Superior Risk Stratification of CMV-Seronegative Kidney Transplant Recipients of a CMV-Seropositive Donor.	"Detectable cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells in CMV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have been attributed to an absence of circulating antibodies despite CMV sensitization. The diagnostic value of CMV-specific T cells, however, needs to be implemented in risk stratification for CMV replication.
Three hundred twenty-six KTRs were studied and classified with respect to CMV serostatus and presence of CMV-specific T cells. Samples were collected pretransplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months posttransplantation. CMV-specific T cells directed to CMV-IE1 and CMV-pp65 were measured by interferon-γ Elispot assay.
Nineteen (28%) of 67 D+R- KTRs showed pretransplant CMV-specific T cells. Although no differences were observed for CMV replication, KTRs with CMV-specific T cells presented with lower initial and peak CMV loads (P < 0.05). KTRs with decreasing/undetectable CMV-IE1-specific T cells pretransplantation and posttransplantation were at greatest risk of CMV replication. KTRs with stable/increasing CMV-IE1-specific T cells from pretransplantation to posttransplantation, however, showed low risk of CMV replication (P < 0.001). One hundred sixty-two (80%) of 203 R+ KTRs showed pretransplant CMV-specific T cells. Decreasing/undetectable CMV-IE1-specific T cells from pretransplantation and posttransplantation identified those R+ KTRs at increased risk of CMV replication (65/80 KTRs; 81%; P < 0.001).
Despite CMV prophylaxis, D+R- KTRs are at greatest risk of CMV disease. Our data suggest that monitoring CMV-specific T cell kinetics from pretransplantation to posttransplantation, particularly directed to CMV-IE1, offers superior risk stratification compared with CMV serostatus alone."

Diabetic kidney transplant recipients: Impaired infection control and increased alloreactivity.	"Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) has been associated with inferior patient and allograft outcomes. However, previous studies did not identify differences in infection control and alloreactivity.
We studied 449 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) between 2005 and 2013. Fifty (11.1%) KTRs were diagnosed with PTDM and 60 (13.4%) KTRs with pre-existing diabetes. Samples were collected pretransplantation, at +1, +2, +3 months post-transplantation. CMV specific and alloreactive T cells were quantified by interferon-γ Elispot assay. Lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry.
Upon multivariate analysis, age, obesity, and the use of tacrolimus increased the risk of PTDM (P<.05). KTRs with pre-existing diabetes/PTDM showed higher rates of sepsis (P<.01). Total CD3+ and CD4+ T cell counts were significantly lower in KTRs with PTDM/pre-existing diabetes post-transplantation (P<.05). No differences were observed for CMV-specific T cells between any group (P>.05). KTRs developing PTDM showed increased frequencies of alloreactive T-cells post-transplantation (P<.05).
Our results suggest higher rates of infection in KTRs with pre-existing diabetes/PTDM that may be attributed to impaired overall immunity. Higher frequencies of alloreactive T cells contribute to inferior long-term outcomes. As acute rejection, but not pre-existing diabetes/PTDM, was associated with inferior allograft survival and function, maintaining adequate immunosuppression to prevent rejection seems important."

Comparative characterization of decellularized renal scaffolds for tissue engineering.	Native extracellular matrix (ECM) provides scaffolds for tissue engineering with natural architecture and biochemical composition. Maintaining the native ECM in decellularized tissues provides cues for cells, which promote their tissue specific arrangement and function. Several approaches have been used to decellularize ECM from the kidney in order to reestablish renal tissue but their comparability is hampered because methods for decellularization and assessment of ECM vary widely. Therefore, we applied a standardized immersion protocol to decellularize porcine kidney tissue with three detergents Triton X-100, SDS and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) at variable temperatures. For comparative analysis decellularization efficacies, structural preservation, composition and cell attachment and viability were analyzed. Structural ECM-conservation is strongly dependent on decellularization temperature, while preservation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG), collagens and cytokines was affected by the detergents used. GAG and collagens were best maintained by 1% SDS at 4 °C, whereas cytokines were best maintained in 1% SDC at 4 °C. Viability and attachment of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived renal precursor cells were best in SDC-ECM and thus not associated with the degree of GAG and collagen maintenance but the cytokine preservation. Based on structural and functional characteristics, we developed a scoring system that allows intra- and inter-study comparison of decellularization strategies. Application of the scoring system to our experimental data showed that decellularization with 1% SDS at 4 °C provided the highest structural and composition scores, while 1% SDC at 4 °C had lower structural and composition but a significantly better cell performance score. Inclusion of multiple published studies in the scoring matrix for comparison identified the highest structural and composition scores when decellularization was performed with SDS at low concentration, for a short period of time and at low temperature. Furthermore, the scoring system indicated that cell attachment and viability cannot be concluded from any other parameter and should therefore always be included in evaluation of decellularization strategies.

Unacceptable human leucocyte antigens for organ offers in the era of organ shortage: influence on waiting time before kidney transplantation.	"The assignment of human leucocyte antigens (HLAs) against which antibodies are detected as unacceptable antigens (UAGs) avoids allocation of HLA- incompatible allografts. There is uncertainty as to what extent UAGs decrease the probability of receiving a kidney offer.
Kidney transplantations in 3264 patients on the waiting lists of six German transplant centres were evaluated for a period of at least 2 years. The proportion of excluded offers due to UAGs was calculated as virtual panel-reactive antibodies (vPRAs).
In the common Eurotransplant Kidney Allocation Scheme, the transplant probability was unaffected by vPRAs in exploratory univariate analyses. In the multivariable model, a 1% increase in vPRA values was outweighed by an additional waiting time of 2.5 weeks. The model was confirmed using an external validation cohort of 1521 patients from seven centres. If only patients with standard risk were considered (e.g. no simultaneous transplantation of other organs), only 1.3 weeks additional waiting time was needed. In the Eurotransplant Senior Program, patients with vPRA values >50% had a strongly reduced transplant probability in the unadjusted analyses. In the multivariable model, a 1% increase in vPRA values was outweighed by an additional waiting time of 5 weeks.
This study demonstrates that the assignment of UAGs decreases the transplant probability in both main Eurotransplant allocation programs because of insufficient compensatory mechanisms. At present, for immunized patients, a prolonged waiting time has to be weighed against the increased immunologic risk due to donor-specific antibodies not assigned as UAGs."

Sepsis after renal transplantation: Clinical, immunological, and microbiological risk factors.	"As immunosuppressive therapy and allograft survival have improved, the increased incidence of sepsis has become a major hurdle of disease-free survival after renal transplantation.
We identified 112 of 957 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with sepsis. In all, 31 KTRs developed severe sepsis or septic shock, and 30 KTRs died from sepsis. KTRs without sepsis were used for comparison. CMV-specific and alloreactive T cells were measured using an interferon-γ Elispot assay. The extent of immunosuppression was quantified by lymphocyte subpopulations.
Five-year patient survival was 70.3% with sepsis compared to 88.2% without (P<.001). Five-year estimated glomerular filtration rate was lower in KTRs developing sepsis (P<.001). Upon multivariate analysis, diabetes, lymphocyte-depleting induction, donor age, CMV replication, and acute rejection increased the risk of sepsis (P<.05). Age, diabetes, underweight/obesity, and pneumonia as site of infection were predictive factors of mortality (P<.05). Early-onset sepsis was associated with decreased CD3+ and CD4+ T cells pre-transplantation (P<.05). Impaired CMV-specific cellular immunity pre-transplantation was associated with CMV replication and early-onset sepsis (P<.05). High frequencies of alloreactive T cells were associated with acute rejection, lymphocyte-depleting rejection treatment, and early-onset sepsis (P<.05).
KTRs developing sepsis show inferior patient survival and allograft function. Identified risk factors and differences in lymphocyte counts, CMV-specific immunity, and alloreactivity may prove useful to identify KTRs at increased risk."

Lipocalin-2 is expressed by activated granulocytes and keratinocytes in affected skin and reflects disease activity in acne inversa/hidradenitis suppurativa.	"Acne inversa (AI)/hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by painful axillary, inguinal and perianal skin lesions with deep-seated nodules, abscesses and fistulae.
This study aimed to identify and characterize the key players in AI pathogenesis.
Epidemiological and anamnestic data for patients with AI were collected, and blood and skin samples were also taken. Healthy participants and patients with psoriasis served as controls. Assessment of samples and cultures of primary cells was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed mRNA, and immunohistochemistry.

Stromal Cells Act as Guardians for Endothelial Progenitors by Reducing Their Immunogenicity After Co-Transplantation.	Regeneration of injured tissues requires effective therapeutic strategies supporting vasculogenesis. The lack of instantly available autologous cell sources and immunogenicity of allogeneic endothelial (progenitor) cells limits clinical progress. Based on the immunosuppressive potency of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs), we investigated whether crosstalk between endothelial colony-forming progenitor cells (ECFCs) and MSCs during vasculogenesis could lower allogeneic T cell responses against ECFCs allowing long-term engraftment in vivo. Immunodeficient mice received subcutaneous grafts containing human ECFCs alone, or pairs of human ECFCs/MSCs from the same umbilical cord (UC) to study vasculogenesis in the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In vitro, cell surface marker changes due to interferon gamma (IFNγ) stimulation during ECFC/MSC coculture were determined and further effects on allostimulated T cell proliferation and cytotoxic lysis were measured. IFNγ-induced HLA-DR expression on ECFCs and MSCs, but both cell types had significantly less HLA-DR in cocultures. ECFC-induced T cell proliferation was abolished after MSC coculture as a result of HLA-DR downregulation and indolamin-2,3-dioxygenase activation.

Sequential Targeting of CD52 and TNF Allows Early Minimization Therapy in Kidney Transplantation: From a Biomarker to Targeting in a Proof-Of-Concept Trial.	"There is high medical need for safe long-term immunosuppression monotherapy in kidney transplantation. Selective targeting of post-transplant alloantigen-(re)activated effector-T cells by anti-TNF antibodies after global T cell depletion may allow safe drug minimization, however, it is unsolved what might be the best maintenance monotherapy.
In this open, prospective observational single-centre trial, 20 primary deceased donor kidney transplant recipients received 2x20 mg Alemtuzumab (d0/d1) followed by 5 mg/kg Infliximab (d2). For 14 days all patients received only tacrolimus, then they were allocated to either receive tacrolimus (TAC, n = 13) or sirolimus (SIR, n = 7) monotherapy, respectively. Protocol biopsies and extensive immune monitoring were performed and patients were followed-up for 60 months.
TAC-monotherapy resulted in excellent graft survival (5yr 92%, 95%CI: 56.6-98.9) and function, normal histology, and no proteinuria. Immune monitoring revealed low intragraft inflammation (urinary IP-10) and hints for the development of operational tolerance signature in the TAC- but not SIR-group. Remarkably, the TAC-monotherapy was successful in all five presensitized (ELISPOT+) patients. However, recruitment into SIR-arm was stopped (after n = 7) because of high incidence of proteinuria and acute/chronic rejection in biopsies. No opportunistic infections occurred during follow-up.
In conclusion, our novel fast-track TAC-monotherapy protocol is likely to be safe and preliminary results indicated an excellent 5-year outcome, however, a full-scale study will be needed to confirm our findings.

Vasodilation and Exercise Capacity in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Prospective Proof-of-Concept Study.	"Previous data have pointed to the fact that vascular function is significantly impaired in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

Purpose The Sequential Treatment of CD20-Positive Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD-1) trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT01458548) established sequential treatment with four cycles of rituximab followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy as a standard in the management of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and identified response to rituximab induction as a prognostic factor for overall survival. We hypothesized that rituximab consolidation might be sufficient treatment for patients with a complete response after rituximab induction. Patients and Methods In this prospective, international, multicenter phase II trial, 152 treatment-naive adult solid organ transplant recipients, with CD20	Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology	2016-12-20	10.1200/JCO.2016.69.3564	['Trappe,RU', 'Dierickx,D', 'Zimmermann,H', 'Morschhauser,F', 'Mollee,P', 'Zaucha,JM', 'Dreyling,MH', 'Dührsen,U', 'Reinke,P', 'Verhoef,G', 'Subklewe,M', 'Hüttmann,A', 'Tousseyn,T', 'Salles,G', 'Kliem,V', 'Hauser,IA', 'Tarella,C', 'Van Den Neste,E', 'Gheysens,O', 'Anagnostopoulos,I', 'Leblond,V', 'Riess,H', 'Choquet,S']	['Ralf U.

CD31+ Cells From Peripheral Blood Facilitate Bone Regeneration in Biologically Impaired Conditions Through Combined Effects on Immunomodulation and Angiogenesis.	Controlled revascularization and inflammation are key elements regulating endogenous regeneration after (bone) tissue trauma. Peripheral blood-derived cell subsets, such as regulatory T-helper cells and circulating (endothelial) progenitor cells, respectively, can support endogenous tissue healing, whereas effector T cells that are associated with an aged immune system can hinder bone regeneration. CD31 is expressed by diverse leukocytes and is well recognized as a marker of circulating endothelial (precursor) cells; however, CD31 is absent from the surface of differentiated effector T cells. Thus, we hypothesized that by separating the inhibitory fractions from the supportive fractions of circulating cells within the peripheral blood (PB) using the CD31 marker, bone regeneration in biologically compromised conditions, such as those observed in aged patients, could be improved. In support of our hypothesis, we detected an inverse correlation between CD31+ cells and effector T cells in the hematomas of human fracture patients, dependent on the age of the patient. Furthermore, we demonstrated the regenerative capacity of human PB-CD31+ cells in vitro. These findings were translated to a clinically relevant rat model of impaired bone healing. The transplantation of rat PB-CD31+ cells advanced bone tissue restoration in vivo and was associated with an early anti-inflammatory response, the stimulation of (re)vascularization, and reduced fibrosis. Interestingly, the depletion or enrichment of the highly abundant CD31+/14+ monocytes from the mixed CD31+ cell population diminished tissue regeneration at different levels, suggesting combined effects within the PB-CD31+ subsets. In summary, an intraoperative enrichment of PB-CD31+ cells might be a novel option to facilitate endogenous regeneration under biologically impaired situations by supporting immunomodulation and vascularization. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Increased alloreactivity and adverse outcomes in obese kidney transplant recipients are limited to those with diabetes mellitus.	Previous studies on patient and allograft outcomes of obese kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) remain controversial. To what extent obesity-related comorbidities contribute to adverse outcomes, however, hasn't been addressed. We studied all KTRs from 2005 to 2012. 29 (4%), 317 (48%), 217 (33%), 76 (12%), and 21 KTRs (4%) were identified as underweight, normal-weight, overweight, obese, and morbid obese, respectively. 33 of 97 obese KTRs (34%) had pre-existent diabetes. Samples were collected before transplantation and at +1, +2, +3months posttransplantation. Donor-reactive T-cells were measured using an interferon-γ Elispot assay. Obese KTRs showed an increased incidence pre-existent diabetes (p<0.001), but no differences for hypertension and coronary artery disease (p>0.05). Among obese KTRs, those with pre-existent diabetes showed inferior patient and allograft survival, worse allograft function, delayed graft function, and prolonged hospitalization (p<0.05). Interestingly, no differences were observed between obese non-diabetic, normal-weight diabetic, and normal-weight non-diabetic KTRs (p>0.05). Obese diabetic KTRs showed higher frequencies of donor-reactive T-cells pretransplantation (p<0.05). Our results suggest that the increased risk of mortality, allograft loss, delayed graft function, and prolonged hospitalization in obese KTRs is limited to those with diabetes. A state of obesity-related inflammation plus hyperglycemia may trigger increased alloreactivity and should call for adequate immunosuppression.

MMP8 Is Increased in Lesions and Blood of Acne Inversa Patients: A Potential Link to Skin Destruction and Metabolic Alterations.	Acne inversa (AI; also designated as hidradenitis suppurativa) is a chronic inflammatory disease with still unknown pathogenesis that affects the intertriginous skin of perianal, inguinal, and axillary sites. It leads to painful nodules, abscesses, and fistulas with malodorous secretion and is frequently associated with metabolic alterations.

Pretransplant prophylactic rituximab to prevent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia in EBV-seronegative kidney transplant recipients from EBV-seropositive donors: results of a pilot study.	"Because of the strikingly increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from EBV-seropositive donors-EBV(D
We studied all KTRs at our center between 2008 and 2012. Seventeen of 402 KTRs (4.2%) were identified as EBV(D
Among 12 EBV-seronegative KTRs from deceased donors, all 12 KTRs (100%) showed EBV seroconversion, 7 KTRs (58%) showed active EBV viremia, and 1 KTR (8%) developed PTLD. In comparison, 3 of 5 KTRs from living donors, who received pretransplant rituximab, remained EBV-seronegative post transplantation, and no KTR developed EBV viremia (P<.05). All KTRs who received pretransplant rituximab showed excellent allograft function, with no increase in infections or malignancies.
Our data suggest that rituximab-mediated elimination of B cells may prevent transmission of EBV to the recipient, as EBV persistence requires the establishment of a latent infection in recipient B cells. Pretransplant rituximab may prove useful to prevent primary EBV infection in EBV-seronegative KTRs."

Kidney transplant recipients after nonrenal solid organ transplantation show low alloreactivity but an increased risk of infection.	The number of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) after nonrenal solid organ transplantation (SOT) has increased to almost 5%. Knowledge on patient and allograft outcomes, infections, and alloreactivity, however, remains scarce. We studied 40 KTRs after nonrenal SOT. Seven hundred and twenty primary KTRs and 119 repeat KTRs were used for comparison. Samples were collected pretransplantation, at +1, +2, and +3 months post-transplantation. Alloreactive and CMV-specific T cells were measured by interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. Patient survival in KTRs after SOT, primary and repeat KTRs was comparable. While death-censored allograft survival was comparable between KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs, KTRs after SOT showed superior 5-year death-censored allograft survival of 92.5% compared to 81.2% in repeat KTRs. Interestingly, KTRs after SOT show less preformed panel-reactive antibodies, frequencies of alloreactive T cells, and acute rejections compared to repeat KTRs. KTRs after SOT, however, show higher incidences of EBV viremia and PTLD, sepsis, and death from sepsis. Impaired CMV-specific cellular immunity was associated with more CMV replication compared to repeat KTRs. Our results suggest comparable patient and allograft outcomes in KTRs after SOT and primary KTRs. The observed low alloreactivity may contribute to excellent allograft outcomes. Caution should be taken in KTRs after SOT regarding infectious complications due to overimmunosuppression.

Wild immunology assessed by multidimensional mass cytometry.	"A great part of our knowledge on mammalian immunology has been established in laboratory settings. The use of inbred mouse strains enabled controlled studies of immune cell and molecule functions in defined settings. These studies were usually performed in specific-pathogen free (SPF) environments providing standardized conditions. In contrast, mammalians including humans living in their natural habitat are continuously facing pathogen encounters throughout their life. The influences of environmental conditions on the signatures of the immune system and on experimental outcomes are yet not well defined. Thus, the transferability of results obtained in current experimental systems to the physiological human situation has always been a matter of debate. Studies elucidating the diversity of ""wild immunology"" imprintings in detail and comparing it with those of ""clean"" lab mice are sparse. Here, we applied multidimensional mass cytometry to dissect phenotypic and functional differences between distinct groups of laboratory and pet shop mice as a source for ""wild mice"". For this purpose, we developed a 31-antibody panel for murine leukocyte subsets identification and a 35-antibody panel assessing various cytokines. Established murine leukocyte populations were easily identified and diverse immune signatures indicative of numerous pathogen encounters were classified particularly in pet shop mice and to a lesser extent in quarantine and non-SPF mice as compared to SPF mice. In addition, unsupervised analysis identified distinct clusters that associated strongly with the degree of pathogenic priming, including increased frequencies of activated NK cells and antigen-experienced B- and T-cell subsets. Our study unravels the complexity of immune signatures altered under physiological pathogen challenges and highlights the importance of carefully adapting laboratory settings for immunological studies in mice, including drug and therapy testing. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry."

Generation of integration free induced pluripotent stem cells from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) patients from urine samples.	Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare, autosomal dominant transmitted genetic disease. Patients experience progressive bone formation replacing tendons, ligaments, muscle and soft tissue. Cause of FOP are gain-of-function mutations in the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) receptor Activin A receptor type 1 (ACVR1) (Kaplan et al., 2008). The most common mutation is R206H, which leads to the substitution of codon 206 from arginine to histidine (Shore et al., 2006). Here, we describe the derivation and characterization of two hiPSC lines from two FOP patients, both carrying the mutation R206H. Cells were isolated from urine and reprogrammed using integration free Sendai virus vectors under defined conditions.

Putting a price tag on novel autologous cellular therapies.	Cell therapies, especially autologous therapies, pose significant challenges to researchers who wish to move from small, probably academic, methods of manufacture to full commercial scale. There is a dearth of reliable information about the costs of operation, and this makes it difficult to predict with confidence the investment needed to translate the innovations to the clinic, other than as small-scale, clinician-led prescriptions. Here, we provide an example of the results of a cost model that takes into account the fixed and variable costs of manufacture of one such therapy. We also highlight the different factors that influence the product final pricing strategy. Our findings illustrate the need for cooperative and collective action by the research community in pre-competitive research to generate the operational models that are much needed to increase confidence in process development for these advanced products.

Effects of Treatment of Asymptomatic Hyperuricemia on Graft Survival and Mortality in Kidney Transplant Recipients.	BACKGROUND Hyperuricemia is very common after renal transplantation. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and graft loss. To date, however, treatment is only recommended in symptomatic disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 503 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin in this retrospective study. Patients were followed up for up to 120 months. All-cause mortality, graft survival, changes in level of serum uric acid (SUA), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed. RESULTS At 12 months post-transplantation, 225 patients had a serum uric acid (SUA) level >7 mg/dl: 52 patients were treated with allopurinol, 37 with benzbromarone, and 136 patients received no medication for hyperuricemia (control). At 12 months, eGFR did not differ between groups (p=0.15) but treated patients had higher SUA levels (p<0.001) compared to the control group. SUA-lowering treatment was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (p=0.013) and graft loss (p=0.014) compared to controls. At 120 months, patients in the treatment group had lower SUA levels (p=0.001) and higher eGFR (p<0.001) compared to the control group.

In the present study, we comparatively analyzed the antibody and T cellular immune response of patients with CVID and unclassified antibody deficiency to influenza vaccination in the season 2013-2014.
Eight patients with CVID, 8 patients with unclassified antibody deficiency and 9 healthy controls were vaccinated with a single dose of non-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. Before and 3 weeks after the vaccination antibody titers against the strains A/California/7/2009, A/Texas/50/2012, and B/Massachusetts/02/2012 included in the vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition testing. Additionally, vaccine-specific T cell cytokine response was determined by stimulation with the complete vaccine in vitro.
Whereas all healthy controls responded to vaccination with serum antibody titers, only 1/8 CVID patients and 4/8 patients with unclassified antibody deficiency showed a response against at least 1 of the 3 vaccine strains. However, 7/8 of the CVID and 6/8 of the patients with unclassified antibody deficiency had similar frequencies of vaccine-induced IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 producing CD40L(+) T cells as the control group.
Our data suggest that most CVID and unclassified antibody deficiency patients benefit from seasonal influenza vaccination by mounting a cellular response."

Early conversion from cyclosporine to everolimus following living-donor kidney transplantation: outcomes at 5 years posttransplant in the randomized ZEUS trial.	"To assess 5-year efficacy, renal, and safety outcomes following early conversion from cyclosporine to everolimus vs. a standard cyclosporine-based regimen in living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients.
The ZEUS study was a randomized, open-label, 1-year, multicenter study in which 300 de novo kidney transplant recipients continued to receive cyclosporine or converted to everolimus at 4.5 months post-transplant, with annual follow-up visits to 5 years post-transplant.
Of the 80 LDKT patients who were randomized, 75 completed the 1-year core study and 60 attended the 5-year follow-up visit. At year 5, 15/31 (48.4%) everolimus patients and 20/29 (69.0%) cyclosporine patients remained on the study drug. Mean adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at year 5 in LDKT recipients was 67.2 vs. 60.8 mL/min/1.73m2 for everolimus vs. cyclosporine (mean difference 6.4 mL/min/1.73m2; p = 0.031). For patients who remained on study drug, the mean difference was 13.2 mL/min/1.73m2 (p = 0.003), but no significant difference was seen in patients who switched from study drug (mean -2.6 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 0.701). Patient and graft survival rates were similar with everolimus and cyclosporine. Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in 22.0% vs. 7.5% of LDKT patients randomized to everolimus vs. cyclosporine (p = 0.116). Only 1 LDKT patient discontinued everolimus due to adverse events during years 1 - 5.
Early initiation of everolimus with calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal after LDKT improved graft function to 5 years post-transplant compared to standard CNI-based therapy. The renal benefit was concentrated in patients who remained on everolimus. An increase in mild acute rejection was not associated with long-term graft loss."

Estimated nephron number of the remaining donor kidney: impact on living kidney donor outcomes.	"It has been demonstrated that low birth weight gives rise to a reduction in nephron number with increased risks for hypertension and renal disease. Its impact on renal function in kidney donors, however, has not been addressed.
To investigate the impact of birth weight, kidney weight, kidney volume and estimated nephron number on kidney function, we collected data from 91 living kidney donors before nephrectomy, at +12, +36 and +60 months after nephrectomy.
Birth weight showed a positive correlation with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at +12, +36 and +60 months after nephrectomy (P < 0.05). The strongest link was observed in donors >50 years old (R = 0.535, P < 0.001 at +12 months). Estimated nephron number and eGFR showed a strong positive correlation at +12, +36 and +60 months after nephrectomy (R = 0.540; R = 0.459; R = 0.506, P < 0.05). Daily proteinuria at +12 months showed a negative correlation with birth weight (P = 0.009). Donors with new-onset hypertension showed significantly lower birth weights and higher uric acid levels (P < 0.05). Kidney weight and volume did not show any impact on donor outcomes (P > 0.05).
Low nephron number predisposes donors to inferior remaining eGFR, hypertension and proteinuria. The strong correlation in elderly donors may be attributed to reduced renal functional reserve due to the decline of renal function with age."

TGFβ-dependent expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 controls CD8(+) T cell anergy in transplant tolerance.	CD8(+) T cell anergy is a critical mechanism of peripheral tolerance, poorly investigated in response to immunotherapy. Here, using a pancreatic islet allograft model and CD3 antibody therapy, we showed, by single cell gene profiling, that intragraft CD8(+) lymphocytes coexpressing granzyme B and perforin were selectively depleted through the Fas/FasL pathway. This step led to long-standing anergy of the remaining CD8(+) T cells marked by the absence of cytotoxic/inflammatory gene expression also confirmed by transcriptome analysis. This sustained unresponsiveness required the presence of the alloantigens. Furthermore, tissue-resident CD8(+) lymphocytes produced TGFβ and expressed the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and PD-L1. Blockade of TGFβ downregulated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and precipitated graft rejection. Neutralizing PD-1, PD-L1 or TGFβRII signaling in T cells also abrogated CD3 antibody-induced tolerance. These studies unravel novel mechanisms underlying CD8(+) T cell anergy and reveal a cell intrinsic regulatory link between the TGFβ and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. 	eLife	2016-01-30	10.7554/eLife.08133	['Baas,M', 'Besançon,A', 'Goncalves,T', 'Valette,F', 'Yagita,H', 'Sawitzki,B', 'Volk,HD', 'Waeckel-Enée,E', 'Rocha,B', 'Chatenoud,L', 'You,S']	['University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, Charité University Medicine, Berlin, Germany.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nLymphocyte Population Biology Unit, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'University Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Paris, France.\nInstitut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale Unit 1151, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 8253, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']
Simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant recipients present with late-onset BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy.	"Infections have increased in simultaneous pancreas/kidney transplant recipients (SPKTRs) with BK polyomavirus (BKV)-associated nephropathy (BKVN) being the most important infectious cause of allograft loss. Comparisons of BKVN with kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), however, are lacking.
We studied all SPKTRs and KTRs at our transplant centre between 2003 and 2012. Eleven of 106 SPKTs (10.4%) and 21 of 1062 KTRs (2.0%) were diagnosed with BKVN with allograft loss in 1 SPKTR (9.1%) and 2 KTRs (9.5%). A control of 95 SPKTRs without BKVN was used for comparison.
SPKTRs showed an increased incidence of BKVN compared with KTRs (P < 0.001). Onset of BKVN in SPKTRs was significantly later compared with KTRs (P = 0.033). While 67% of KTRs showed early-onset BKVN, 64% of SPKTRs developed late-onset BKVN. Older recipient age and male gender increased the risk of BKVN in SPKTRs (P < 0.05). No differences were observed for patient and allograft survival (P > 0.05). However, SPKTRs with BKVN showed inferior estimated glomerular filtration rate and a higher incidence of de novo donor-specific antibodies compared with SPKTRs without BKVN in long-term follow-up (P < 0.05). SPKTRs showed higher peak BKV loads, a need for more intense therapeutic intervention and were more likely not to recover to baseline creatinine after BKVN (P < 0.05).
Our results suggest a higher incidence, more severe course and inferior outcome of BKVN in SPKTRs. An increased vulnerability of the allograft kidney due to inferior organ quality may predispose KTRs to early-onset BKVN. In contrast, SPKTRs present with late-onset BKVN in the presence of high-dose immunosuppression."

Interleukin-29 induces epithelial production of CXCR3A ligands and T-cell infiltration.	"Psoriasis is considered as a model for chronic immune-mediated disorders. Th17-cells are pivotal players in those diseases. Recently, we demonstrated that Th17-cells produce interleukin (IL)-29 and that IL-29 is highly present in psoriatic lesions. Whether IL-29, with its action on epithelial cells and melanocytes, contributes to psoriasis pathogenesis, was unknown so far. Analysis of IL-29-treated human keratinocytes revealed induction of the chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, and, to a much lesser extent, CXCL9. Unlike these CXCR3A ligands, known to attract Th1-, CD8(+), NK-, and Th1/Th17 transient cells, no influence was found on chemokines attracting other immune cell populations or on molecules modulating the CXCR3A/CXCR3A ligand interaction. CXCR3A ligand expression was also induced by IL-29 in melanocytes and in epidermis models and explanted skin. Regarding other psoriasis-relevant cytokines, interferon-γ and, less potently, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β shared and strengthened IL-29's capacity. Murine IL-29 counterpart injected into mouse skin provoked local CXCL10 and CXCL11 expression, T-cell infiltration, and, in consequence, skin swelling. The elevated IL-29 expression in psoriatic lesions was associated with upregulation of CXCR3A ligands compared to non-lesional skin of these patients and to the skin of healthy donors and atopic dermatitis patients, which lack IL-29 production. Importantly, neutralization of IL-29 reduced CXCR3A ligand levels in explant cultures of psoriatic lesions. Finally, elevated blood CXCL11 levels were found in psoriasis that might be useful for monitoring lesional activity of the IL-29 axis. In summary, the Th17-cytokine IL-29 induces specific chemokines and, in consequence, provokes skin infiltration of potentially pathogenic T-cells.
IL-29 selectively induces CXCR3A-binding chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) in skin cells. Murine IL-29 counterpart induces skin T-cell infiltration and inflammation in mice. CXCR3A ligands are IL-29-dependently increased in lesional skin of psoriasis patients. CXCR3A ligand levels in psoriatic skin correlate with epidermal T-cell numbers. Increased blood CXCL11 levels in psoriasis may be a biomarker for local IL-29 action."

Cholinergic Pathway Suppresses Pulmonary Innate Immunity Facilitating Pneumonia After Stroke.	"Temporary immunosuppression has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of pneumonia after acute central nervous system injury. Although overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system was previously shown to mediate suppression of systemic cellular immune responses after stroke, the role of the parasympathetic cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the antibacterial defense in lung remains largely elusive.
The middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice was used to examine the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on poststroke immunosuppression. We used heart rate variability measurement by telemetry, vagotomy, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-deficient mice, and parasympathomimetics (nicotine, PNU282987) to measure and modulate parasympathetic activity.
Here, we demonstrate a rapidly increased parasympathetic activity in mice after experimental stroke. Inhibition of cholinergic signaling by either vagotomy or by using α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-deficient mice reversed pulmonary immune hyporesponsiveness and prevented pneumonia after stroke. In vivo and ex vivo studies on the role of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on different lung cells using bone marrow chimeric mice and isolated primary cells indicated that not only macrophages but also alveolar epithelial cells are a major cellular target of cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling in the lung.
Thus, cholinergic pathways play a pivotal role in the development of pulmonary infections after acute central nervous system injury."

Frequent IgG subclass and mannose binding lectin deficiency in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a severe disease characterized by various symptoms of immune dysfunction. CFS onset is typically with an infection and many patients suffer from frequently recurrent viral or bacterial infections. Immunoglobulin and mannose binding lectin (MBL) deficiency are frequent causes for increased susceptibility to infections. In this study we retrospectively analysed 300 patients with CFS for immunoglobulin and MBL levels, and B-cell subset frequencies. 25% of the CFS patients had decreased serum levels of at least one antibody class or subclass with IgG3 and IgG4 subclass deficiencies as most common phenotypes. However, we found elevated immunoglobulin levels with an excess of IgM and IgG2 in particular in another 25% of patients. No major alteration in numbers of B cells and B-cell subsets was seen. Deficiency of MBL was found in 15% of the CFS patients in contrast to 6% in a historical control group. In a 2nd cohort of 168 patients similar frequencies of IgG subclass and MBL deficiency were found. Thus, humoral immune defects are frequent in CFS patients and are associated with infections of the respiratory tract.

Strain Lattice Imprinting in Graphene by C60 Intercalation at the Graphene/Cu Interface.	Intercalation of C60 molecules at the graphene-substrate interface by annealing leads to amorphous and crystalline structures. A comparison of topography and electronic structure with wrinkles and moiré patterns confirms intercalation. The intercalated molecules imprint a local strain/deformation on the graphene layer whose magnitude is controlled by the intermolecular distance. The crystalline intercalated structure exhibits a superlattice peak in the local density of states. This work provides control of local strain in graphene.

The Pelargonium sidoides Extract EPs 7630 Drives the Innate Immune Defense by Activating Selected MAP Kinase Pathways in Human Monocytes.	Pelargonium sidoides is a medical herb and respective extracts are used very frequently for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. However, the effects of Pelargonium sidoides and a special extract prepared from its roots (EPs 7630) on human immune cells are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that EPs 7630 induced a rapid and dose-dependent production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 by human blood immune cells. This EPs 7630-induced cytokine profile was more pro-inflammatory in comparison with the profile induced by viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. The search for EPs 7630 target cells revealed that T-cells did not respond to EPs 7630 stimulation by production of TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-10. Furthermore, pretreatment of T-cells with EPs 7630 did not modulate their TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion during subsequent activation. In contrast to lymphocytes, monocytes showed clear intracellular TNF-α staining after EPs 7630 treatment. Accordingly, EPs 7630 predominantly provoked activation of MAP kinases and inhibition of p38 strongly reduced the monocyte TNF-α production. The pretreatment of blood immune cells with EPs 7630 lowered their secretion of TNF-α and IL-10 and caused an IL-6 dominant response during second stimulation with viral or bacterial infection-mimicking agents. In summary, we demonstrate that EPs 7630 activates human monocytes, induces MAP kinase-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in these cells, and specifically modulates their production capacity of mediators known to lead to an increase of acute phase protein production in the liver, neutrophil generation in the bone marrow, and the generation of adaptive Th17 and Th22 cells.

Antibodies to β adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.	Infection-triggered disease onset, chronic immune activation and autonomic dysregulation in CFS point to an autoimmune disease directed against neurotransmitter receptors. Autoantibodies against G-protein coupled receptors were shown to play a pathogenic role in several autoimmune diseases. Here, serum samples from a patient cohort from Berlin (n=268) and from Bergen with pre- and post-treatment samples from 25 patients treated within the KTS-2 rituximab trial were analysed for IgG against human α and β adrenergic, muscarinic (M) 1-5 acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin receptors by ELISA and compared to a healthy control cohort (n=108). Antibodies against β2, M3 and M4 receptors were significantly elevated in CFS patients compared to controls. In contrast, levels of antibodies against α adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin receptors were not different between patients and controls. A high correlation was found between levels of autoantibodies and elevated IgG1-3 subclasses, but not with IgG4. Further patients with high β2 antibodies had significantly more frequently activated HLA-DR+ T cells and more frequently thyreoperoxidase and anti-nuclear antibodies. In patients receiving rituximab maintenance treatment achieving prolonged B-cell depletion, elevated β2 and M4 receptor autoantibodies significantly declined in clinical responder, but not in non-responder. We provide evidence that 29.5% of patients with CFS had elevated antibodies against one or more M acetylcholine and β adrenergic receptors which are potential biomarkers for response to B-cell depleting therapy. The association of autoantibodies with immune markers suggests that they activate B and T cells expressing β adrenergic and M acetylcholine receptors. Dysregulation of acetylcholine and adrenergic signalling could also explain various clinical symptoms of CFS.

Regulatory T cell-mediated anti-inflammatory effects promote successful tissue repair in both indirect and direct manners.	Regulatory T cells (Tregs) offer new immunotherapeutic options to control undesired immune reactions, such as those in transplant rejection and autoimmunity. In addition, tissue repair and regeneration depend on a multitude of tightly regulated immune and non-immune cells and signaling molecules. There is mounting evidence that adequate innate responses, and even more importantly balanced adaptive immune responses, are key players in the tissue repair and regeneration processes, even in absence of any immune-related disease or infection. Thus, the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic capacities of Treg can affect not only the effector immune response, creating the appropriate immune environment for successful tissue repair and regeneration, but growing evidence shows that they also have direct effects on tissue cell functions. Here we summarize the present views on how Treg might support tissue regeneration by direct control of undesired immune reactivity and also by direct interaction with non-immune tissue cells. We describe tissue-resident Treg and their specific phenotypes in skin, visceral adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. In addition, we touch on the topic of osteoimmunology, discussing the direct interactions of Treg with bone-forming cells, such as osteoblasts and their mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) progenitors-a field which is under-investigated. We hypothesize a cross-talk between Treg and bone-forming cells through the CD39-CD73-(adenosine)-adenosine receptor pathway, which might also potentiate the differentiation of MSCs, thus facilitating bone regeneration. This hypothesis may provide a road map for further investigations on the cross-talk between the immune and the skeletal system, and also enable the development of better strategies to promote bone repair and regeneration.

Altered B-cell subsets and functional B-cell defects in selective IgM deficiency.	Primary selective IgM deficiency (sIgM) is characterized by diminished serum IgM, infections and autoimmunity. Although there is some evidence of B-cell defects the pathogenesis of sIgM is poorly understood. We determined peripheral B-cell subsets and IgM-expression levels in 31 adult sIgM patients by flow cytometry. In a subset of patients B-cell subset alterations and antibody-secreting cells were determined by flow cytometry and ELISpot assay after in vitro differentiation.Patients had significantly increased transitional, decreased IgM only, switched and non-switched memory B cells and decreased membrane IgM-expression levels on memory B-cell subsets compared to healthy controls. A strongly diminished B-cell differentiation and expansion capacity was observed in 5/6 investigated patients. Severely reduced IgM-secreting capacity was detected in 2/6 patients.Taken together, our results show altered B-cell subsets and severe functional B-cell defects in sIgM. This may provide a diagnostic tool and basis for subclassification of patients to study the pathogenetic background.

Polymorphism in COMT is associated with IgG3 subclass level and susceptibility to infection in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.	"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is considered as a neuroimmunological disease but the etiology and pathophysiology is poorly understood. Patients suffer from sustained exhaustion, cognitive impairment and an increased sensitivity to pain and sensory stimuli. A subset of patients has frequent respiratory tract infections (RRTI). Dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system and an association with genetic variations in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and glucocorticoid receptor genes influencing sympathetic and glucocorticoid metabolism were reported in CFS. Here, we analyzed the prevalence of SNPs of COMT and glucocorticoid receptor-associated genes in CFS patients and correlated them to immunoglobulin levels and susceptibility to RRTI.
We analyzed blood cells of 74 CFS patients and 76 healthy controls for polymorphisms in COMT, FKBP5 and CRHR1 by allelic discrimination PCR. Serum immunoglobulins were determined by immunoturbidimetric technique, cortisol levels by ECLIA.
Contrary to previous reports, we found no difference between CFS patients and healthy controls in the prevalence of SNPs for COMT, FKBP5 and CRHR1. In patients with the Met/Met variant of COMT rs4680 we observed enhanced cortisol levels providing evidence for its functional relevance. Both enhanced IgE and diminished IgG3 levels and an increased susceptibility to RRTI were observed in CFS patients with the Met/Met variant. Such an association was not observed in 68 non-CFS patients with RRTI.
Our results indicate a relationship of COMT polymorphism rs4680 with immune dysregulation in CFS providing a potential link for the association between stress and infection susceptibility in CFS."

A revised strategy for monitoring BKV-specific cellular immunity in kidney transplant patients.	Reactivation of Polyomavirus BKV is a severe complication in kidney transplant patients. Current treatment requires close monitoring, and modification of immunosuppressive drugs. As an important additional tool, the monitoring of BKV immunity has been based on detection of cytokine-secreting T cells upon BKV-antigen challenge. However, low frequent BKV-specific T cells are often barely detectable and their roles in BKV clearance remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the effects of immunosuppressive agents on BKV-specific T cells in vitro. Significant reductions in expression of several markers, and reduced killing functions upon treatment with calcineurin but not mTOR inhibitors were detected. However, effects of these drugs on expression of surface markers and GranzymeB were substantially less striking than effects on cytokine expression. Consequently, we applied a novel detection strategy for BKV-specific T cells in immunosuppressed kidney transplant patients using these more robust markers, and showed significantly improved sensitivity compared with the conventional IFNγ-based method. Using this strategy and 17-color flow cytometry, we found BKV-specific helper and cytolytic CD4+ T-cell subsets that differed in their memory phenotype, which corresponded with BKV clearance in kidney transplant patients. Thus, our results offer an improved detection strategy for BKV-specific T cells in kidney transplant patients, and shed light on the contributions of these cells to BKV clearance.

Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Prevent Allostimulation In Vivo and Control Checkpoints of Th1 Priming: Migration of Human DC to Lymph Nodes and NK Cell Activation.	Although the immunomodulatory potency of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) is well established, the mechanisms behind are still not clear. The crosstalk between myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and natural killer (NK) cells and especially NK cell-derived interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) play a pivotal role in the development of type 1 helper (Th1) cell immune responses. While many studies explored the isolated impact of MSC on either in vitro generated DC, NK, or T cells, there are only few data available on the complex interplay between these cells. Here, we investigated the impact of MSC on the functionality of human mDC and the consequences for NK cell and Th1 priming in vitro and in vivo. In critical limb ischemia patients, who have been treated with allogeneic placenta-derived mesenchymal-like stromal cells (PLX-PAD), no in vivo priming of Th1 responses toward the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatches could be detected. Further in vitro studies revealed that mDC reprogramming could play a central role for these effects. Following crosstalk with MSC, activated mDC acquired a tolerogenic phenotype characterized by reduced migration toward CCR7 ligand and impaired ability to stimulate NK cell-derived IFN-γ production. These effects, which were strongly related to an altered interleukin (IL)-12/IL-10 production by mDC, were accompanied by an effective prevention of Th1 priming in vivo. Our findings provide novel evidence for the regulation of Th1 priming by MSC via modulation of mDC and NK cell crosstalk and show that off-the-shelf produced MHC-mismatched PLX-PAD can be used in patients without any sign of immunogenicity.

Comparing Humoral and Cellular Immune Response Against HBV Vaccine in Kidney Transplant Patients.	Host protection upon vaccination usually results from the complex interplay of humoral and cellular components of the immune system. Exploring hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-specific T cell responses and their correlation with humoral responses under immunosuppression, we analyzed 51 renal transplant recipients, differing in HBV vaccine-specific antibody titers (non [NRs]-, low [LRs]-, and high responders [HRs]) and in 22 healthy controls (HCs) in a cross-sectional study. HBsAg-specific T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry according to expression of activation markers CD40L and/or CD69, and the cytokines IFNγ, IL-2, TNFα, and IL-17. No significant differences in responder rate and magnitude of HBsAg-specific T cell responses were found between HCs and HRs. Interestingly, HBsAg-specific Th-cells were also observed in 50% of humoral NRs. Frequencies of HBsAg-specific CD40L+ Th-cells were significantly higher in HRs compared to LRs (p = 0.009) and in LRs in comparison to NRs (p = 0.043). All but NRs showed a predominance of multi-potent HBsAg-specific TNFα+IL-2+ Th-cells. As expected, HBsAg-specific CD8(+) T cells were rarely found. In conclusion, mounting of hepatitis B vaccine-specific T cell responses is possible in kidney transplant recipients despite immunosuppression. Detection of HBV-specific Th-cells in a significant proportion of humoral NRs contributes to the current discussion on conferring immune protection by cellular memory in such patients.

Gene therapy: a possible future standard for HIV care.	Despite undeniable accomplishments in developing cell and gene therapeutic strategies to combat HIV infection, key social, economic, and policy-related challenges still need to be overcome for any future commercialization efforts of these novel therapies to be successful. Here, we address these challenges and structure a framework for eradicating HIV/AIDS using gene therapy.

IL-15 dependent induction of IL-18 secretion as a feedback mechanism controlling human MAIT-cell effector functions.	"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are characterized by an invariant TCRVα7.2 chain recognizing microbial vitamin B metabolites presented by the MHC-Ib molecule MR1. They are mainly detectable in the CD8(+) and CD8(-) CD4(-) ""double negative"" T-cell compartments of mammals and exhibit both Th1- and Th17-associated features. As MAIT cells show a tissue-homing phenotype and operate at mucosal surfaces with myriads of pathogenic encounters, we wondered how IL-15, a multifaceted cytokine being part of the intestinal mucosal barrier, impacts on their functions. We demonstrate that in the absence of TCR cross-linking, human MAIT cells secrete IFN-γ, increase perforin expression and switch on granzyme B production in response to IL-15. As this mechanism was dependent on the presence of CD14(+) cells and sensitive to IL-18 blockade, we identified IL-15 induced IL-18 production by monocytes as an inflammatory, STAT5-dependent feedback mechanism predominantly activating the MAIT-cell population. IL-15 equally affects TCR-mediated MAIT-cell functions since it dramatically amplifies bacteria-induced IFN-γ secretion, granzyme production, and cytolytic activity at early time points, an effect being most pronounced under suboptimal TCR stimulation conditions. Our data reveal a new quality of IL-15 as player in an inflammatory cytokine network impacting on multiple MAIT-cell functions.

ABO desensitization affects cellular immunity and infection control after renal transplantation.	The impact of ABO desensitization on overall immunity, infectious control, and alloreactivity remains unknown. We compared 35 ABO-incompatible kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) to a control of 62 ABO compatible KTRs. Samples were collected before, at +1, +2, +3, +6, and +12 months post-transplantation. CMV-, BKV-specific, and alloreactive T cells were measured using an interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. The extent of immunosuppression was quantified by enumeration of lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokines. No differences were observed for 5-year allograft survival and function between both groups (P > 0.05). However, ABO-incompatible KTRs were more likely to develop CMV infection, BKV-associated nephropathy, and severe sepsis (P = 0.001). Interestingly, ABO-incompatible KTRs with poor HLA-match showed the highest rates of infections and inferior allograft function (P < 0.05). CD3+, CD4+ T-cell counts, interferon-γ and IL-10 levels were lower in ABO-incompatible KTRs early post-transplantation (P < 0.05). Likewise, ABO-incompatible KTRs showed impaired BKV- and CMV-specific T-cell immunity (P < 0.05). ABO-incompatible KTRs showed lower frequencies of alloreactive T cells (P < 0.05). Our data suggest T-cell depletion due to ABO desensitization, which may contribute to the increased risk of T-cell-dependent infections. Elimination of B cells serving as antigen-presenting cells, thereby causing impaired T-cell activation, plays a significant role in both impaired infection control and reduced alloreactive T-cell activation.

Human CD45RA(-) FoxP3(hi) Memory-Type Regulatory T Cells Show Distinct TCR Repertoires With Conventional T Cells and Play an Important Role in Controlling Early Immune Activation.	Adoptive immunotherapy with regulatory T cells (Treg) is a new option to promote immune tolerance following solid organ transplantation (SOT). However, Treg from elderly patients awaiting transplantation are dominated by the CD45RA(-) CD62L(+) central memory type Treg subset (TregCM), and the yield of well-characterized and stable naïve Treg (TregN) is low. It is, therefore, important to determine whether these TregCM are derived from the thymus and express high stability, suppressive capacity and a broad antigen repertoire like TregN. In this study, we showed that TregCM use a different T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire from conventional T cells (Tconv), using next-generation sequencing of all 24 Vβ families, with an average depth of 534 677 sequences. This showed almost no contamination with induced Treg. Furthermore, TregCM showed enhanced suppressive activity on Tconv at early checkpoints of immune activation controlling activation markers expression and cytokine secretion, but comparable inhibition of proliferation. Following in vitro expansion under mTOR inhibition, TregCM expanded equally as well as TregN without losing their function. Despite relatively limited TCR repertoire, TregCM also showed specific alloresponse, although slightly reduced compared to TregN. These results support the therapeutic usefulness of manufacturing Treg products from CD45RA(-) CD62L(+) Treg-enriched starting material to be applied for adoptive Treg therapy.

Different risk factor profiles distinguish early-onset from late-onset BKV-replication.	Two of three reactivations of latent BKV-infection occur within the first 6 months after renal transplantation. However, a clear differentiation between early-onset and late-onset BKV-replication is lacking. Here, we studied all kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) at our single transplant center between 2004 and 2012. A total of 103 of 862 KTRs were diagnosed with BK viremia (11.9%), among which 24 KTRs (2.8%) showed progression to BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVN). Sixty-seven KTRs with early-onset BKV-replication (65%) and 36 KTRs with late-onset BKV-replication (35%) were identified. A control group of 598 KTRs without BKV-replication was used for comparison. Lymphocyte-depleting induction, CMV-reactivation, and acute rejection increased the risk of early-onset BKV-replication (P < 0.05). Presensitized KTRs undergoing renal retransplantation were those at increased risk of late-onset BKV-replication (P < 0.05). Among KTRs with BK viremia, higher doses of mycophenolate increased the risk of progression to BKVN (P = 0.004). KTRs with progression to BKVN showed inferior allograft function (P < 0.05). KTRs with late-onset BK viremia were more likely not to recover to baseline creatinine after BKV-replication (P = 0.018). Our data suggest different risk factors in the pathogenesis of early-onset and late-onset BKV-reactivation. While a more intensified immunosuppression is associated with early-onset BKV-replication, a chronic inflammatory state in presensitized KTRs may contribute to late-onset BKV-replication.

Immunogenicity of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells: what has been seen in vitro and in vivo?	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising candidates for supporting regeneration and suppressing undesired immune reactivity. Although autologous MSC have been most commonly used for clinical trials, data on application of allogeneic MHC-unmatched MSC were reported. The usage of MSC as an 'off-the-shelf' product would have several advantages; however, it is an immunological challenge. The preclinical studies on the (non)immunogenicity of MSC are contradictory and, unfortunately, solid data from clinical trials are missing. Induction of an alloresponse would be a major limitation for the application of allogeneic MSC. Here we discuss the key elements for the induction of an alloresponse and targets of immunomodulation by MSC as well as preclinical and clinical hints on allo(non)response to MSC.

Peripheral blood-derived virus-specific memory stem T cells mature to functional effector memory subsets with self-renewal potency.	Memory T cells expressing stem cell-like properties have been described recently. The capacity of self-renewal and differentiation into various memory/effector subsets make them attractive for adoptive T cell therapy to combat severe virus infections and tumors. The very few reports on human memory stem T cells (T(SCM)) are restricted to analyses on polyclonal T cells, but extensive data on Ag-specific T(SCM )are missing. This might be due to their very low frequency limiting their enrichment and characterization. In this article, we provide functional and phenotypic data on human viral-specific T(SCM), defined as CD8(+)CD45RA(+)CCR7(+)CD127(+)CD95(+). Whereas <1% of total T cells express the T(SCM) phenotype, human CMV-specific T(SCM) can be detected at frequencies similar to those seen in other subsets, resulting in ∼ 1 /10,000 human CMV-specific T(SCM). A new virus-specific expansion protocol of sort-purified T(SCM) reveals both upregulation of various T cell subset markers and preservation of their stem cell phenotype in a significant proportion, indicating both self-renewal and differentiation potency of virus-specific T cells sharing their TCR repertoire. Furthermore, we describe a simplified culture protocol that allows fast expansion of virus-specific T(SCM) starting from a mixed naive T/T(SCM) pool of PBLs. Due to the clinical-grade compatibility, this might be the basis for novel cell therapeutic options in life-threatening courses of viral and tumor disease.

Late-Onset Disseminated Mycobacterium avium intracellulare Complex Infection (MAC), Cerebral Toxoplasmosis and Salmonella Sepsis in a German Caucasian Patient with Unusual Anti-Interferon-Gamma IgG1 Autoantibodies.	"Since we described for the first time a patient with IgG4 autoantibodies to IFN-γ more than 10 years ago, many patients with IFN-γ IgG4 autoantibodies have been described, mostly in Mongolian/ Asian patients with a particular HLA background and in association with disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Very recently, the first Caucasian US patient was reported and we now present the case of a 65-year old Caucasian woman with severe disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection, cerebral toxoplasmosis and salmonella sepsis who was tested positive for IFN-γ deficiency due to unusual anti-IFN-γ IgG1 autoantibodies.
IFN-γ production after ex vivo ConA stimulation of the patient's whole blood and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed. Anti-human IFN-γ antibodies were measured by Ig/Ig-subclass-specific ELISA. In vitro physiologic relevance and blocking capacity of IFN-γ-stimulation by patient's serum was analysed by flow cytometric assessment of cytokine-induced phosphorylation of pSTAT1(Y701).
Severely impaired IFN-γ production in the patient's whole blood but normal production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of autologous serum was observed. High titre anti-IFN-γ antibodies of the IgG1 subclass could be demonstrated in the patient's serum by ELISA. Further, the addition of patient's serum to IFN-γ-stimulated immune cells showed inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation.

The Loss of BKV-specific Immunity From Pretransplantation to Posttransplantation Identifies Kidney Transplant Recipients at Increased Risk of BKV Replication.	Quantification of BKV-load and BKV-specific immunity have been evaluated to monitor BKV-replication and outcomes in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with BKV-infection. However, it remains crucial to better understand how immune markers can predict the risk for later infection. We studied all KTRs between 2008 and 2011. Twenty-four KTRs were diagnosed with BKV-replication and a control group of 127 KTRs was used for comparison. Samples were collected before at +1, +2, and +3 months posttransplantation. BKV-specific and alloreactive T cells were measured using an interferon-γ Elispot assay. The extent of immunosuppression was quantified by lymphocyte subpopulations and interferon-gamma levels. KTRs with a loss of BKV-specific T cells directed to Large T-antigen from pretransplantation to posttransplantation were at increased risk of BKV-replication (p < 0.001). In contrast, KTRs with stable/rising BKV-specific T cells were more likely not to develop BKV-replication (p < 0.05). KTRs developing BKV-replication showed significantly lower CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and interferon-γ levels posttransplantation, but significantly higher alloreactive T cells (p < 0.05). Monitoring pretransplant and posttransplant BKV-specific T cells is suggested a sensitive marker to identify KTRs at increased risk of BKV-replication. Increased susceptibility to immunosuppression predisposes KTRs to a loss of protective BKV-specific immunity that results in impaired virus control and BKV-replication.

Impaired Endothelial Regeneration Through Human Parvovirus B19-Infected Circulating Angiogenic Cells in Patients With Cardiomyopathy.	Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) is a common pathogen in microvascular disease and cardiomyopathy, owing to infection of endothelial cells. B19V replication, however, is almost restricted to erythroid progenitor cells (ErPCs). Endothelial regeneration attributable to bone marrow-derived circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) is a prerequisite for organ function. Because of many similarities of ErPCs and CACs, we hypothesized that B19V is a perpetrator of impaired endogenous endothelial regeneration. B19V DNA and messenger RNA from endomyocardial biopsy specimens, bone marrow specimens, and circulating progenitor cells were quantified by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The highest B19V DNA concentrations were found in CD34(+)KDR(+) cells from 17 patients with chronic B19V-associated cardiomyopathy. B19V replication intermediates could be detected in nearly half of the patients. Furthermore, chronic B19V infection was associated with impaired endothelial regenerative capacity. B19V infection of CACs in vitro resulted in expression of transcripts encoding B19V proteins. The capsid protein VP1 was identified as a novel inducer of apoptosis, as were nonstructural proteins. Inhibition studies identified so-called death receptor signaling with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10 to be responsible for apoptosis induction. B19V causally impaired endothelial regeneration with spreading of B19V in CACs in an animal model in vivo. We thus conclude that B19V infection and damage to CACs result in dysfunctional endogenous vascular repair, supporting the emergence of primary bone marrow disease with secondary end-organ damage.

International prognostic index, type of transplant and response to rituximab are key parameters to tailor treatment in adults with CD20-positive B cell PTLD: clues from the PTLD-1 trial.	Tailoring treatment by patient strata based on the risk of disease progression and treatment toxicity might improve outcomes of patients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We analysed the cohort of 70 patients treated in the international, multicenter phase II PTLD-1 trial (NCT01458548) to identify such factors. Of the previously published scoring systems in PTLD, the international prognostic index (IPI), the PTLD prognostic index and the Ghobrial score were predictive for overall survival. None of the scoring systems had a considerable effect on the risk for disease progression. Age and ECOG performance status were the baseline variables with the highest prognostic impact in the different scoring systems. Baseline variables not included in the scoring systems that had an impact on overall survival and disease progression were the type of transplant and the response to rituximab at interim staging. Thoracic organ transplant recipients who did not respond to rituximab monotherapy were at particularly high risk for death from disease progression with subsequent CHOP-based chemotherapy. Patients in complete remission after four courses of rituximab and patients in partial remission with low-risk IPI had a low risk of disease progression. We speculate that chemotherapy might not be necessary in this patient cohort.

Atomic scale surface structure and morphology of InAs nanowire crystal superlattices: the effect of epitaxial overgrowth.	While shell growth engineering to the atomic scale is important for tailoring semiconductor nanowires with superior properties, a precise knowledge of the surface structure and morphology at different stages of this type of overgrowth has been lacking. We present a systematic scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study of homoepitaxial shell growth of twinned superlattices in zinc blende InAs nanowires that transforms {111}A/B-type facets to the nonpolar {110}-type. STM imaging along the nanowires provides information on different stages of the shell growth revealing distinct differences in growth dynamics of the crystal facets and surface structures not found in the bulk. While growth of a new surface layer is initiated simultaneously (at the twin plane interface) on the {111}A and {111}B nanofacets, the step flow growth proceeds much faster on {111}A compared to {111}B leading to significant differences in roughness. Further, we observe that the atomic scale structures on the {111}B facet is different from its bulk counterpart and that shell growth on this facet occurs via steps perpendicular to the ⟨112⟩B-type directions.

Central Role of CD45RA- Foxp3hi Memory Regulatory T Cells in Clinical Kidney Transplantation Tolerance.	The role of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in operational tolerance remains elusive, as initial results revealed an increased frequency of this subset in tolerant patients but no functional differences compared with immunosuppressed recipients. In addition, recent studies of regulatory B cells strongly suggest that Tregs may not have a central role in kidney transplantation tolerance. However, recent investigations of the crucial role of Foxp3 demethylation in Treg function and the possibility of identifying distinct Foxp3 T cell subsets prompted us to more thoroughly characterize Tregs in operationally tolerant patients. Thus, we studied the level of demethylation of the Foxp3 Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in circulating CD4(+) T cells and analyzed Treg subset frequency in tolerant patients, healthy volunteers, patients with stable graft function under immunosuppression, and chronically rejecting recipients. We observed a higher proportion of CD4(+) T cells with demethylated Foxp3 and a specific expansion of CD4(+) CD45RA(-) Foxp3(hi) memory Tregs exclusively in tolerant patients. The memory Tregs of tolerant recipients exhibited increased Foxp3 TSDR demethylation, expressed higher levels of CD39 and glucocorticoid-induced TNF-related receptor, and harbored greater suppressive properties than memory Tregs from patients with stable graft function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that operationally tolerant patients mobilize an array of potentially suppressive cells, including not only regulatory B cells but also Tregs. Our results also indicate that tolerant patients have potent CD4(+)CD45RA(-) Foxp3(hi) memory Tregs with a specific Foxp3 TSDR demethylation pattern, which may contribute to the maintenance of graft tolerance.

Five-year outcomes in kidney transplant patients converted from cyclosporine to everolimus: the randomized ZEUS study.	ZEUS study was an open-label, 12-month, multicenter study in which 300 de novo kidney transplant recipients were randomized to continue receiving cyclosporine (CsA) or convert to everolimus at 4.5 months posttransplant. Five-year follow-up data were available for 245/269 patients (91.1%) who completed the core 12-month study (123 everolimus, 109 CsA). At 5 years, adjusted estimated GFR was 66.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with everolimus versus 60.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with CsA; the mean difference was 5.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in favor of everolimus (95% CI 2.4, 8.3; p < 0.001 [intent-to-treat population]). In a post hoc analysis of patients remaining on study drug at 5 years (everolimus 77, CsA 86), mean difference was 8.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (95% CI 4.3, 12.1; p < 0.001) in favor of everolimus. The cumulative incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection postrandomization was 13.6% with everolimus versus 7.5% with CsA (p = 0.095), largely accounted for by grade I rejection (16/21 patients and 7/11 patients, respectively). Postrandomization, graft loss, mortality, serious adverse events and neoplasms were similar in both arms. In conclusion, conversion of kidney transplant patients to everolimus at 4.5 months posttransplant is associated with a significant improvement in renal function that is maintained to at least 5 years. The increase in early mild acute rejection did not affect long-term graft function.

Renal, efficacy and safety outcomes following late conversion of kidney transplant patients from calcineurin inhibitor therapy to everolimus: the randomized APOLLO study.	"The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate, based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), superior renal function at month 12 after conversion of maintenance kidney transplant patients from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to everolimus, compared to continuing a standard CNI regimen.
APOLLO was an open-label, 12-month, prospective, multicenter study in which 93 maintenance kidney transplant patients were randomized to convert from CNI to everolimus (n = 46) or remain on standard CNI-based immunosuppression (n = 47). The primary efficacy variable was eGFR (Nankivell formula) 12 months after randomization. The study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment and was thus underpowered.
Mean time post-transplant was 83.5 months with everolimus and 70.1 months with CNI. Adjusted values for eGFR (Nankivell) at month 12 were 61.6 (95% CI 58.1, 65.1) mL/ min/1.73 m² with everolimus and 58.8 (95% CI 55.2, 62.3) mL/min/1.73 m² with CNI, a difference of 2.8 (95% CI -1.0, 6.7) mL/ min/1.73 m² (p = 0.145) i.e., the primary objective was not met. Using the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula, adjusted eGFR at month 12 was significantly higher with everolimus (p = 0.030). In the subpopulation who remained on the study drug (n = 52), the difference in the adjusted change from randomization was 6.6 (95% CI 1.5, 11.6) mL/min/1.73 m² (p = 0.013) in favor of everolimus. There was no biopsyproven acute rejection and no graft losses. Adverse events led to discontinuation of everolimus and CNI in 32.6% and 10.6% of patients, respectively.
Conversion from CNI to everolimus to preserve renal function can be considered several years after kidney transplantation and does not compromise immunosuppressive efficacy."

Interleukin-10 receptor-1 expression in monocyte-derived antigen-presenting cell populations: dendritic cells partially escape from IL-10's inhibitory mechanisms.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine that mediates its effects via a transmembrane receptor complex consisting of two different chains, IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. While IL-10R2 is ubiquitously expressed and does not bind IL-10 primarily, the expression of IL-10R1 determines cellular responsiveness. However, the current knowledge about the expression and regulation of IL-10R1 is still limited. Here we analyzed the expression of IL-10R1 on monocytic cells and demonstrated that human blood monocytes carried about 720 IL-10-binding sites on their surface. Compared with lymphocytes and various tissue cells and tissues, blood monocytes expressed the highest IL-10R1 levels. The in vitro differentiation of these cells into macrophages provoked a further increase of IL-10R1 surface expression. In contrast, their differentiation into myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) resulted in reduced surface IL-10R1 levels. The different IL-10R1 levels expressed by monocyte-derived antigen-presenting cell populations were reflected in their different responsiveness toward IL-10. Importantly, also in vivo developed immature macrophages and mDCs showed different IL-10 sensitivity. These data suggest that, compared with monocytes and macrophages, mDCs partially escape from IL-10's inhibitory mechanisms by downregulating IL-10R1.

A roadmap toward clinical translation of genetically-modified stem cells for treatment of HIV.	During the past decade, successful gene therapies for immunodeficiencies were finally brought to the clinic. This was accomplished through new gene therapy vectors and improved procedures for genetic modification of autologous hematopoietic stem cells. For HIV, autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy with 'anti-HIV genes' promises a functional cure for the disease. However, to develop such a therapy and translate it into a clinical application is rather challenging. The risks and benefits of such a therapy have to be understood, and regulatory hurdles need to be overcome. In this joint paper by academic researchers and regulators, we are, therefore, outlining a high level roadmap for the early stage development of HSC gene therapy as a potential functional cure for HIV.

Human bone marrow contains a subset of quiescent early memory CD8(+) T cells characterized by high CD127 expression and efflux capacity.	Even today it is still not completely understood how CD8(+) T-cell memory is maintained long term. Since bone marrow (BM) is a niche for immunological memory, we sought to identify long-lasting early memory CD8(+) T cells in this compartment. To achieve this, we looked for CD8(+) T cells that are able to efflux Rhodamine 123, a typical property of stem cells. Indeed, we identified a distinct subset of CD8(+) T cells in BM, with the capacity to efflux and high CD127 expression. These CD127(hi) effluxers are conventional CD8(+) T cells exhibiting a broad TCR-Vβ repertoire and are generated in response to viral peptides in vitro. CD127(hi) effluxer CD8(+) T cells have an early memory phenotype defined by preferential TNF-α production and a Bcl-2(hi) , KLRG-1(low) profile. This population has long telomeres and shows constitutively low frequencies of Ki-67 expression ex vivo, but has a high proliferative and differentiation capacity in vitro. However, IL-15 downmodulates CD127 in CD127(hi) effluxer CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Consequently, the CD127(low) effluxer subset may comprise cells recently exposed to IL-15. Taken together, CD127(hi) effluxer CD8(+) T cells represent a novel population of early memory T cells resident in BM with properties required for long-lived memory.

Deficient cutaneous antibacterial competence in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas: role of Th2-mediated biased Th17 function.	"Primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are neoplastic disorders of skin-homing T cells. Affected skin areas show morphologic similarities with alterations in other T-cell-mediated dermatoses. Furthermore, as in atopic dermatitis but in contrast with psoriasis, patients with CTCL are frequently afflicted by cutaneous bacterial infections that support the survival of lymphoma cells. Our aim was to investigate the mechanisms of elevated susceptibility to cutaneous infections in patients with CTCL.
Skin samples from CTCL, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis patients were used to illuminate the antibacterial competence status and the presence of its modulating cytokines. For substantiation of findings, 3-dimensional epidermis models, isolated and in vitro generated Th-subpopulations, were applied. Parameters were analyzed via qPCR and IHC.
CTCL lesions compared with psoriatic lesions presented an impaired upregulation of antibacterial proteins (ABPs), with levels even below those in atopic dermatitis. This was associated with a relative deficiency of the ABP-inducing cytokine IL-17 and a strong presence of the ABP-downregulating cytokine IL-13. The simultaneous presence of the Th17-cell cytokine IL-26 indicated that IL-17 deficiency in CTCL lesions results from functional deviation of Th17 cells. Accordingly, IL-17 but not IL-26 production by Th17 cells in vitro was inhibited by IL-4Rα ligand. Levels of other ABP inducers were comparable between CTCL and psoriasis lesions. The same was true about IL-22/TNF-α targets, including the keratinocyte hyper-regeneration marker K16 and the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP1.
Our results suggest that the cutaneous bacterial infections in CTCL are caused by impaired ABP induction as consequence of Th2-mediated biased Th17-cell function."

Renal function to 5 years after late conversion of kidney transplant patients to everolimus: a randomized trial.	"Few trials have investigated late preemptive conversion of kidney transplant patients from a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) to an mTOR inhibitor.
In an open-label, 12-month, prospective, randomized, parallel-group study, maintenance kidney transplant patients (>6 months post-transplant) either switched from CNI to everolimus or continued their current CNI regimen. Patients who completed the core study were followed to 5 years post-randomization.
Of 93 randomized patients, 78 completed the core study and 67 attended the final 60-month study visit. Mean time post-transplant at baseline was 82.6 months and 70.5 months in the everolimus and CNI groups, respectively. At month 60, adjusted mean eGFR (Nankivell) was 63.0 (95% CI 57.8, 68.2) mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the everolimus group versus 57.9 (95% CI 52.6, 63.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the CNI group, a difference of 5.1 (95% CI -0.6, 10.8) mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p = 0.076). Among patients who remained on randomized study drug at month 60, mean eGFR (Nankivell) was 71.6 (95% CI 64.2, 79.0) mL/min/1.73 m(2) in everolimus-treated patients (n = 21) versus 60.6 (95% CI 55.1, 66.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2) in CNI-treated patients (n = 29) (mean difference 11.0; 95% CI 3.6, 18.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.005). No cases of BPAR occurred from randomization to month 60 in either group. Graft loss occurred in three everolimus-treated patients and one CNI-treated patient. No unexpected safety concerns were observed in either group.
Late preemptive conversion of maintenance kidney transplant patients from CNI to everolimus may be associated with improved long-term renal function and preserves immunosuppressive efficacy.

Clindamycin-primaquine for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in renal transplant patients.	"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is considered first-line therapy for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) in renal transplant patients. Alternatives have not been formally studied. Clindamycin-primaquine (C-P) is effective in HIV-associated PCP, but data in renal transplant patients are lacking.
Retrospective cohort study of 57 consecutive renal transplant patients who developed PCP and were treated with C-P (n = 23) or TMP/SMX (n = 34).
A non-significantly higher failure rate was observed in patients on C-P due to lack of efficacy (30.4 versus 20.6%, p = 0.545). The difference was more pronounced in severe PCP (60 versus 37.5%, p = 0.611) and a significantly lower efficacy of C-P was seen when used as salvage therapy. The two patients who had received C-P after not responding to TMP/SMX failed this regimen, but all seven patients who had failed initial treatment with C-P and had been switched to TMP/SMX were cured (p = 0.028). No treatment-limiting adverse reactions were reported for patients on C-P while six patients (17.6%) on TMP/SMX developed possibly related treatment-limiting toxicity (p = 0.071). However, in only two patients adverse events were definitely related to TMP/SMX (5.9%).
Clindamycin-primaquine appears to be safe and well tolerated for treating PCP in renal transplant patients but is probably less effective than TMP/SMX, the standard regimen. However, our data indicates that C-P represents an acceptable alternative for patients with contraindications or treatment emergent toxicities during TMP/SMX use. Notably, TMP/SMX was also acceptably tolerated in most patients. TMP/SMX remains an effective salvage regimen in case of C-P failure."

Classification of common variable immunodeficiencies using flow cytometry and a memory B-cell functionality assay.	"The population of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) comprises a heterogeneous group of patients with different causes of hypogammaglobulinemia predisposing to recurrent infections, higher incidence of autoimmunity, and malignancy. Although memory B cells (memBcs) are key players in humoral defense and their numbers are commonly reduced in these patients, their functionality is not part of any current classification.
We established and validated a memBc enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay that reveals the capacity of memBcs to develop into antibody-secreting cells and present an idea for a new classification based on this functional capacity.
The memBc ELISpot assay, combined with flow cytometry, was applied to patients with confirmed CVID in comparison with age-matched healthy control subjects.
Ex vivo frequency of IgG-, IgM-, and IgA-secreting plasmablasts was significantly diminished by 27.2-, 2.4-, and 23.3-fold, respectively, compared with that seen in healthy control subjects. Moreover, in vitro differentiation of memBcs into antibody-secreting cells was 6.1-, 2.6-, and 3.7-fold significantly reduced for IgG-, IgM-, and IgA-secreting cells, respectively. Proliferation of memBcs correlates inversely to immunoglobulin-secreting capacity, suggesting compensatory hyperproliferation. Furthermore, patients with no serum IgA can still have a detectable IgA ELISpot assay result in vitro. Most importantly, the large heterogeneity of memBc function in patients with CVID homogenously grouped by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting allowed additional subclassification based on memBc/plasmablast function.
These data suggest almost normal memBc/immunoglobulin-secreting plasmablast functionality in some patients if sufficient stimulatory signals are delivered, which might open up opportunities for new therapeutic approaches."

Efficacy and safety of conversion from cyclosporine to everolimus in living-donor kidney transplant recipients: an analysis from the ZEUS study.	Conversion of living-donor kidney transplant patients from calcineurin inhibitor therapy to an mTOR inhibitor is poorly documented. In the prospective, multicentre ZEUS study, 300 kidney transplant recipients without prior rejection (Banff grade >1) and serum creatinine ≤265 μmol/l were randomized to continue cyclosporine or convert to everolimus at 4.5 months post-transplant. In a post hoc analysis of 80 living-donor recipients, adjusted estimated GFR (Nankivell) at month 12 (the primary endpoint) was 74.3 (95% CI [70.7, 77.9]) ml/min/1.73 m(2) with everolimus versus 63.8 (95% CI [60.0, 67.7]) ml/min/1.73 m(2) ) with cyclosporine, a difference of 10.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in favour of everolimus (P < 0.001). From randomization to month 12, adjusted estimated GFR increased by a mean of 9.8 (95% CI [6.2, 13.4]) ml/min/1.73 m(2) with everolimus versus -0.7 (95% CI [-4.6, 3.1]) ml/min/1.73 m(2) ) (P < 0.001) with cyclosporine. There were six biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes in everolimus-treated patients (five Banff grade I) and one episode in cyclosporine-treated patients (Banff grade 1). Overall safety profile was similar between groups. Discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in three everolimus patients (7.1%) and five cyclosporine patients (13.2%) between randomization and month 12. Initiation of everolimus with early elimination of calcineurin therapy is associated with a significant renal benefit at 12 months post-transplant that is observed in both living and deceased-donor recipients.

The role of CD4(+) T cells in BKV-specific T cell immunity.	Reactivation of polyomavirus BK (BKV) infection represents a severe complication in kidney transplant (KTX) patients. We previously reported an association between a declining BK viral load and the reconstitution of CD4(+) T cell BKV-specific immunity in patients following kidney transplantation. However, the specific contribution of CD4(+) T cells in the regulation of BKV-replication is unknown. Nevertheless, in vitro enrichment of BKV-specific T cells and subsequent adoptive T cell transfer may improve the restoration of immune competence in KTX patients with BKV infection. To date, strategies to capture human BKV-specific T cells with the ensuing expansion to clinically useful numbers are lacking. Here, we demonstrated a comprehensive flow cytometric analysis of the BKV-specific T cell response that permits access to the majority of T cells specific for immunodominant BKV antigens. A full-spectrum evaluation of the BKV-specific T cell response was performed by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a mixture of BKV immunodominant peptide pools at varying concentrations and measuring activation marker expression and cytokine secretion. We also examined the effects of co-stimulation and PBMC resting time prior to activation. We defined the narrow range of stimulation conditions that permit the capture and expansion of functional BKV-specific T cell lines. The generated BKV-specific T cell lines showed the highest specificity and functionality when the T cells were captured according to IFNγ-secretion. This study highlights the multifunctional and cytolytic BKV-specific CD4(+) T cells as a dominant population within the generated T cell product. This method offers a novel approach for the generation of BKV-specific T cell lines for adoptive immunotherapy and underscores the critical role of CD4(+) T cells in the clearance of BKV.

IL-19 is a component of the pathogenetic IL-23/IL-17 cascade in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease with characteristic skin alterations and functions as a model of immune-mediated disorders. Cytokines have a key role in psoriasis pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that out of 30 individually quantified cytokines, IL-19 showed the strongest differential expression between psoriatic lesions and healthy skin. Cutaneous IL-19 overproduction was reflected by elevated IL-19 blood levels that correlated with psoriasis severity. Accordingly, anti-psoriatic therapies substantially reduced both cutaneous and systemic IL-19 levels. IL-19 production was induced in keratinocytes by IL-17A and was further amplified by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-22. Among skin cells, keratinocytes were found to be important targets of IL-19. IL-19 alone, however, regulated only a few keratinocyte functions. While increasing the production of S100A7/8/9 and, to a moderate extent, also IL-1β, IL-20, chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 8, and matrix metalloproteinase 1, IL-19 had no clear influence on the differentiation, proliferation, or migration of these cells. Importantly, IL-19 amplified many IL-17A effects on keratinocytes, including the induction of β-defensins, IL-19, IL-23p19, and T helper type 17-cell- and neutrophil-attracting chemokines. In summary, IL-19 as a component of the IL-23/IL-17 axis strengthens the IL-17A action and might be a biomarker for the activity of this axis in chronic inflammatory disorders.

Risk-stratified cardiovascular screening including angiographic and procedural outcomes of percutaneous coronary interventions in renal transplant candidates.	Background. Benefits of cardiac screening in kidney transplant candidates (KTC) will be dependent on the availability of effective interventions. We retrospectively evaluated characteristics and outcome of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in KTC selected for revascularization by a cardiac screening approach. Methods. In 267 patients evaluated 2003 to 2006, screening tests performed were reviewed and PCI characteristics correlated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) during a follow-up of 55 months. Results. Stress tests in 154 patients showed ischemia in 28 patients (89% high risk). Of 58 patients with coronary angiography, 38 had significant stenoses and 18 cardiac interventions (6.7% of all). 29 coronary lesions in 17/18 patients were treated by PCI. Angiographic success rate was 93.1%, but procedural success rate was only 86.2%. Long lesions (P = 0.029) and diffuse disease (P = 0.043) were associated with MACE. In high risk patients, cardiac screening did not improve outcome as 21.7% of patients with versus 15.5% of patients without properly performed cardiac screening had MACE (P = 0.319). Conclusion. The moderate procedural success of PCI and poor outcome in long and diffuse coronary lesions underscore the need to define appropriate revascularization strategies in KTC, which will be a prerequisite for cardiac screening to improve outcome in these high-risk patients.

Current characteristics and outcome of cytomegalovirus infections after kidney transplantation.	"The clinical course of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in the current era is poorly described. We characterized the symptoms and outcome of all CMV infections in a large cohort of kidney transplant recipients. Among 1129 kidney transplant recipients transplanted between 2004 and 2011 in Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Helsinki University Hospital, 297 patients with CMV infection were characterized.
CMV disease occurred in 217/1129 patients (19.2%), and CMV infection in 297/1129 (26.3%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded in 58% and fever in 47% patients with primary CMV disease, compared to 46% and 27% patients with symptomatic CMV reactivation, whereas leukopenia or thrombocytopenia were seen in only 17-28% patients, and malaise in 9-10%. Tissue-invasive CMV gastroenteritis was confirmed in 11% and CMV pneumonia in only 1% of patients with CMV disease. Only 1 patient died because of CMV infection (mortality 0.3%). Virus-related factors or the use of secondary prophylaxis did not predict the risk of recurrence, which occurred in 33% patients.
In conclusion, CMV disease remains a common problem after kidney transplantation. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common, especially in patients with primary CMV infection, whereas bone marrow suppression, hepatopathy, or malaise were seen less frequently."

Fcγ-receptor IIIA polymorphism p.158F has no negative predictive impact on rituximab therapy with and without sequential chemotherapy in CD20-positive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.	We retrospectively analyzed the p.V158F polymorphism of Fcγ-receptor IIIA (FCGR3A, CD16) in patients with PTLD treated with rituximab monotherapy. Previous reports had indicated that the lower affinity F allele affects rituximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and is linked to inferior outcome of rituximab monotherapy in B cell malignancies. 25 patients with PTLD after solid organ transplantation were included in this analysis. They had received 4 weekly doses of rituximab as part of two clinical trials, which had a rituximab monotherapy induction regimen in common. 16/25 patients received further treatment with CHOP-21 after rituximab monotherapy (PTLD-1, NCT01458548). The FCGR3A status was correlated to the response after 4 cycles of rituximab monotherapy. Response to rituximab monotherapy was not affected by F carrier status. This is in contrast to previous findings in B cell malignancies where investigators found a predictive impact of FCGR3A status on outcome to rituximab monotherapy. One explanation for this finding could be that ADCC is impaired in transplant recipients receiving immunosuppression. These results suggest that carrying a FCRG3A F allele does not negatively affect rituximab therapy in immunosuppressed patients.

T and B cells participate in bone repair by infiltrating the fracture callus in a two-wave fashion.	Fracture healing is a regenerative process in which bone is restored without scar tissue formation. The healing cascade initiates with a cycle of inflammation, cell migration, proliferation and differentiation. Immune cells invade the fracture site immediately upon bone damage and contribute to the initial phase of the healing process by recruiting accessory cells to the injury site. However, little is known about the role of the immune system in the later stages of fracture repair, in particular, whether lymphocytes participate in soft and hard callus formation. In order to answer this question, we analyzed femoral fracture healing in mice by confocal microscopy. Surprisingly, after the initial inflammatory phase, when soft callus developed, T and B cells withdrew from the fracture site and were detectable predominantly at the femoral neck and knee. Thereafter lymphocytes massively infiltrated the callus region (around day 14 after injury), during callus mineralization. Interestingly, lymphocytes were not found within cartilaginous areas of the callus but only nearby the newly forming bone. During healing B cell numbers seemed to exceed those of T cells and B cells progressively underwent effector maturation. Both, osteoblasts and osteoclasts were found to have direct cell-cell contact with lymphocytes, strongly suggesting a regulatory role of the immune cells specifically in the later stages of fracture healing.

Percutaneous computer tomography-guided ethanol sympathicolysis for the treatment of resistant arterial hypertension.	"As an alternative to catheter-based radiofrequency (RF) ablation, renal sympathicolysis can also be achieved by image-guided percutaneous injection of ethanol around the renal artery.

To be, or not to be immunocompetent.	Several data support the view that impairment of the inflammatory-immune response is a hallmark of severe sepsis and the level and time of recovery to immunocompetence has a major impact on the clinical outcome of ICU patients. Recent studies demonstrate that improvement of anti-tumour immune response by targeting negative regulatory molecules, such as CD25, chronic T-lymphocyte activation antigen 4, and programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/PD-1 L, offers a novel opportunity to prevent or even reverse progression of tumour growth in experimental models and patients. Likewise, severe sepsis is associated with enhanced expression of those negative regulatory molecules, suggesting a novel approach to reverse immunoparalysis in sepsis. Consequently, targeting negative molecules in sepsis can reverse immunoparalysis and improve survival in experimental sepsis, as shown by Chang and colleagues in a recent issue of Critical Care. This opens new opportunities to overcome overwhelming downregulation of the adaptive immune response to prevent and/or improve recovery from sepsis.

Novel GMP-compatible protocol employing an allogeneic B cell bank for clonal expansion of allospecific natural regulatory T cells.	"The adoptive transfer of natural regulatory T cells (nTreg) is a new option to reshape undesired immune reactivity in autoimmunity and transplantation toward ""tolerance."" The first clinical trials using adoptive transfer of polyclonal nTreg demonstrated safety and hints of efficacy. However, the low frequencies of antigen-specific cells among the pool of polyclonal nTreg and their broad antigen nonspecific suppression are limitations of this approach regarding efficacy and safety. Recently, the isolation and expansion of (allo)antigen-specific nTreg have successfully been achieved by using Treg-specific activation markers but the yield is relatively low. Here, we describe a novel good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible expansion protocol of alloantigen-specific nTreg based on the stimulation of nTreg by allogeneic activated B cells. Their functionality and specificity are superior compared to polyclonal nTreg both in vitro and in vivo. Employing an allogeneic B cell bank, designed to cover the majority of HLA types, allows fast GMP-compliant manufacturing for donor-specific nTreg for clinical application in organ and stem cell transplantation. TCR repertoire analyses by next generation sequencing revealed impressive expansion by several log-steps of even very low-abundance alloantigen-specific nTreg clones. This novel method offers a simple approach for expanding antigen-specific nTreg and is characterized by high replicability and easy transferability to full GMP standards.

While we observed no difference in viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG antibodies, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA)-IgG titers were low or absent in 10% of CFS patients. Remarkably, when analyzing the EBV-specific memory B-cell reservoir in vitro a diminished or absent number of EBNA-1- and VCA-antibody secreting cells was found in up to 76% of patients. Moreover, the ex vivo EBV-induced secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ was significantly lower in patients. Multicolor flow cytometry revealed that the frequencies of EBNA-1-specific triple TNF-α/IFN-γ/IL-2 producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets were significantly diminished whereas no difference could be detected for HCMV-specific T-cell responses. When comparing EBV load in blood immune cells, we found more frequently EBER-DNA but not BZLF-1 RNA in CFS patients compared to healthy controls suggesting more frequent latent replication. Taken together, our findings give evidence for a deficient EBV-specific B- and T-cell memory response in CFS patients and suggest an impaired ability to control early steps of EBV reactivation. In addition the diminished EBV response might be suitable to develop diagnostic marker in CFS.

Prevalence of occult hepatitis C infection in chronic hemodialysis and kidney transplant patients.	"Detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or hepatocytes in absence of HCV RNA in serum, designated as 'occult HCV infection', has been a matter of controversy in recent years. We investigated for the first time the prevalence of occult HCV infection in large cohorts of chronic hemodialysis (CHD) and kidney transplant (KTx) patients.
We enrolled 417 CHD patients, 417 KTx recipients and 2 control groups - 25 anti-HCV (antibody against HCV)-positive and HCV RNA-positive patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 40 anti-HCV-, HCV RNA-, and HBsAg-negative healthy subjects. HCV RNA was tested in serum and PBMC using a sensitive commercial assay.
In CHD patients, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 3.6% (15/417) and of positive serum HCV RNA 2.4% (10/417). HCV RNA was detected in PBMC in 1/407 (0.25%) HCV serum RNA-negative patients (""occult HCV infection""). In KTx recipients, prevalence of anti-HCV was 4.8% (20/417) and of positive serum HCV RNA 4.6% (19/417). Occult HCV infection was found in 2/398 (0.5%) serum HCV RNA-negative patients. On a mean longitudinal follow-up of 30months of the 3 patients with occult HCV infection, there was no clinical or virological evidence of HCV infection.
The prevalence of occult HCV infection was very low in our CHD and KTx patients, and it did not appear to be clinically relevant. Further studies in geographic populations with high HCV endemicity are required to clarify the significance of occult HCV infection in these patient groups."

Interleukin-23 deficiency leads to impaired wound healing and adverse prognosis after myocardial infarction.	"CD4+ cells are implicated in the healing process after myocardial infarction (MI). We sought to investigate the role of interleukin-23 (IL-23) deficiency, a cytokine important in differentiation of CD4+ cells, in scar formation of the ischemic heart.
MI was performed in wild-type and IL23p19-/- mice. Thirty-day mortality, hemodynamic function 4 days after MI and myocardial inflammation, and remodeling 4 and 30 days after MI were examined. Differentiation of fibroblasts from infarcted and noninfarcted hearts into myofibroblasts was examined under basal conditions and after stimulation with interferon-γ, IL-17α and IL-23. Interleukin-23p19-/- mice showed higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and immune cell infiltration in the scar early after MI compared with wild-type mice. A stronger interferon-γ/Th1 reaction seemed to be responsible for the increased inflammation under IL-23 deficiency. Expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), collagen I and III was significantly higher in the heart tissue and isolated cardiac fibroblasts 4 days after MI in the wild-type mice. Interleukin-23p19-/- mice showed impaired healing compared with wild-type mice, as seen by significantly higher mortality because of ventricular rupture (40% higher after 30 days) and stronger left ventricular dilation early after MI. Stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts with interferon-γ, the main Th1 cytokine, but not with IL-23 or IL-17α, led to a significant downregulation of α-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and III and decreased migration and differentiation to myofibroblasts.
IL-23 deficiency leads to increased myocardial inflammation and decreased cardiac fibroblast activation, associated with impaired scar formation and adverse remodeling after MI."	Circulation.

Inflammatory activation and recovering BKV-specific immunity correlate with self-limited BKV replication after renal transplantation.	As BKV-associated nephropathy has emerged as an important cause of allograft failure, it has been of major importance to find immune mechanisms suitable to identify kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) at increased risk of BKV replication. We monitored 29 KTRs with seven measurements during the first year post-transplantation. BKV-specific T cells directed to 5 BKV proteins were analyzed in an interferon-γ ELISPOT assay. BKV-specific antibodies were measured using an ELISA. The extent of immunosuppression and inflammatory activation were quantified by measures of immune function including lymphocyte subpopulations, IP-10, and adhesion molecule serum levels. All 5 BKV-specific T cells increased significantly from diagnosis to resolution of BKV replication (P<0.001). While antistructural T cells were significantly higher in KTRs with BKV replication (P<0.05), no differences were observed for antismall t- and large T-antigen-directed T cells (P>0.05). Interestingly, 65% of KTRs without BKV replication showed transient appearance of antismall t- and large T-antigen-directed T cells. Although no significant differences were observed for T-cell subpopulations and adhesion molecules, IP-10 levels increased significantly during BKV replication (P<0.05). Assessment of BKV-specific T cells identifies recovering BKV-specific immunity in KTRs with BKV replication and suggests their protective ability in KTRs without BKV replication. Increases in IP-10 levels stress the importance of infiltrating inflammatory leukocytes in the regulation of BKV replication and point to inflammatory activation in the pathogenesis of BKV replication.

Discrimination of T-cell subsets and T-cell receptor repertoire distribution.	Flow cytometry-based analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires is an essential tool for the detection of clonal T-cell expansions in physiologic and pathologic conditions. Individual T-cell subsets can be investigated based on their surface properties. The aims of our study were to provide reference values for various disease settings and delineate the contribution of individual TCR repertoires to the human T-cell differentiation pathway. We analyzed blood of 66 healthy subjects aged 0 (cord blood) to 72 years. Lymphocyte subpopulations and TCR repertoires were simultaneously explored using antibodies specific to CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CCR7, CD27, CD57 and a set of 25 antibodies detecting human TCR-Vβ chains. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon, paired t and ANOVA tests. Initially, TCR expansion values were calculated based on the analysis of TCR-Vβ distribution on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We then established gating strategies and an algorithm for data analysis allowing for discrimination of T-cell subsets and TCR distribution. Dominant TCR expansions were present within effector as opposed to central/effector memory or naive cells, e.g., median TCR-Vβ expansion rate was highest on CD45RA+/CCR7- effector CD4+/8+ cells (eight and 11-fold, respectively). Remarkably, TCR expansions were missing (0) or very low (0.5) on CD4+ and CD8+ central memory population, respectively. No significant gender-related variability of TCR repertoires was identified, and significant impact of chronic cytomegalovirus infection was shown. Our results serve as reference for future studies elucidating clonal TCR dominance of T-cell subsets.

The SCIentinel study--prospective multicenter study to define the spinal cord injury-induced immune depression syndrome (SCI-IDS)--study protocol and interim feasibility data.	"Infections are the leading cause of death in the acute phase following spinal cord injury and qualify as independent risk factor for poor neurological outcome (""disease modifying factor""). The enhanced susceptibility for infections is not stringently explained by the increased risk of aspiration in tetraplegic patients, neurogenic bladder dysfunction, or by high-dose methylprednisolone treatment. Experimental and clinical pilot data suggest that spinal cord injury disrupts the balanced interplay between the central nervous system and the immune system. The primary hypothesis is that the Spinal Cord Injury-induced Immune Depression Syndrome (SCI-IDS) is 'neurogenic' including deactivation of adaptive and innate immunity with decreased HLA-DR expression on monocytes as a key surrogate parameter. Secondary hypotheses are that the Immune Depression Syndrome is i) injury level- and ii) severity-dependent, iii) triggers transient lymphopenia, and iv) causes qualitative functional leukocyte deficits, which may endure the post-acute phase after spinal cord injury.
SCIentinel is a prospective, international, multicenter study aiming to recruit about 118 patients with acute spinal cord injury or control patients with acute vertebral fracture without neurological deficits scheduled for spinal surgery. The assessment points are: i) <31 hours, ii) 31-55 hours, iii) 7 days, iv) 14 days, and v) 10 weeks post-trauma. Assessment includes infections, concomitant injury, medication and neurological classification using American Spinal Injury Association impairment scale (AIS) and neurological level. Laboratory analyses comprise haematological profiling, immunophenotyping, including HLA-DR expression on monocytes, cytokines and gene expression of immune modulators. We provide an administrative interim analysis of the recruitment schedule of the trial.
The objectives are to characterize the dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune system after spinal cord injury and to explore its proposed 'neurogenic' origin by analyzing its correlation with lesion height and severity. The trial protocol considers difficulties of enrolment in an acute setting, and loss to follow up. The administrative interim analysis confirmed the feasibility of the protocol. Better understanding of the SCI-IDS is crucial to reduce co-morbidities and thereby to attenuate the impact of disease modifying factors to protect neurological ""outcome at risk"". This putatively results in improved spinal cord injury medical care.

Standardization of whole blood immune phenotype monitoring for clinical trials: panels and methods from the ONE study.	"Immune monitoring by flow cytometry is a fast and highly informative way of studying the effects of novel therapeutics aimed at reducing transplant rejection or treating autoimmune diseases. The ONE Study consortium has recently initiated a series of clinical trials aimed at using different cell therapies to promote tolerance to renal allografts. To compare the effectiveness of different cell therapies, the consortium developed a robust immune monitoring strategy, including procedures for whole blood (WB) leukocyte subset profiling by flow cytometry.
Six leukocyte profiling panels computing 7- to 9-surface marker antigens for monitoring the major leukocyte subsets as well as characteristics of T cell, B cell, and dendritic cell (DC) subsets were designed. The precision and variability of these panels were estimated. The assay was standardized within eight international laboratories using Flow-Set Pro beads for mean fluorescence intensity target definition and the flow cytometer setup procedure. Standardization was demonstrated by performing inter-site comparisons.
Optimized methods for sample collection, storage, preparation, and analysis were established, including protocols for gating target subsets. WB specimen age testing demonstrated that staining must be performed within 4 hours of sample collection to keep variability low, meaning less than or equal to 10% for the majority of defined leukocyte subsets. Inter-site comparisons between all participating centers testing shipped normal WB revealed good precision, with a variability of 0.05% to 30% between sites. Intra-assay analyses revealed a variability of 0.05% to 20% for the majority of subpopulations. This was dependent on the frequency of the particular subset, with smaller subsets showing higher variability. The intra-assay variability performance defined limits of quantitation (LoQ) for subsets, which will be the basis for assessing statistically significant differences achieved by the different cell therapies.
Local performance and central analysis of the ONE Study flow cytometry panel yields acceptable variability in a standardized assay at multiple international sites. These panels and procedures with WB allow unmanipulated analysis of changes in absolute cell numbers of leukocyte subsets in single- or multicenter clinical trials. Accordingly, we propose the ONE Study panel may be adopted as a standardized method for monitoring patients in clinical trials enrolling transplant patients, particularly trials of novel tolerance promoting therapies, to facilitate fair and meaningful comparisons between trials."

Culture surface influence on T-cell phenotype and function.	When dealing with T lymphocyte culture there is currently very less information available about the interaction between T-cells and the culture system. In this study we look at the influence of the culture chamber on T-cell proliferation in two main aspects of the culture system, namely: culture chamber material and geometry. The study was carried out using unique polymeric closed cell culture inserts, which were processed via injection moulding from polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), polyetherurethane (PEU), polystyrene-co-acrylonitrile (PSAN) and polyetherimide (PEI). Furthermore culture chamber geometry was studied using commercially available 24, 12 and 6-well plates prepared from tissue culture plastic (TCP). For T lymphocyte stimulation two methods were used involving either EBV peptide pools or MACS iBead particles depending on the experiment performed. Culture was done with 1645 RPMI medium supplemented with foetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin and rhIL-2. We found four materials out of five we tested (PS, PC, PSAN and PEI) exhibited similar fold expansions with minimal influence on proportions of CD4 and CD8, while PEU had a negative influence on T cell growth along with adversely affected CD4/CD8 proportions. Changes in the geometry of TCP had no effect on T cell growth or maturation rather the size of geometry seems to have more influence on proliferation. T-cells appear to prefer smaller geometries during initial stages of culture while towards the end of the culture size becomes less significant to cell proliferation. The parameters tested in this study have significant influences on T-cell growth and are necessary to consider when designing and constructing expansion systems for antigen specific T lymphocytes. This is important when culturing T-cells for immunotherapeutic applications where antigen specificity, T-cell maturation and function should remain unaffected during culture.

IL-29 is produced by T(H)17 cells and mediates the cutaneous antiviral competence in psoriasis.	Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) are the most common chronic inflammatory skin diseases. Although both patient groups show strongly impaired skin barrier function, only AD patients frequently suffer from cutaneous viral infections. The mechanisms underlying the distinct susceptibilities to these pathogenetic and often life-threatening infections are unknown. We show that antiviral proteins (AVPs) such as MX1, BST2, ISG15, and OAS2 were strongly elevated in psoriatic compared to AD lesions and healthy skin. Of 30 individually quantified cytokines in psoriatic lesions, interleukin-29 (IL-29) was the only mediator whose expression correlated with the AVP levels. IL-29 was absent in AD lesions, and neutralization of IL-29 in psoriatic skin reduced AVP expression. Accordingly, IL-29 raised AVP levels in isolated keratinocytes, epidermis models, and human skin explants, but did not influence antibacterial protein production. AVP induction correlated with increased antiviral defense of IL-29-treated keratinocytes. Furthermore, IL-29 elevated the expression of signaling elements, resulting in increased sensitivity of keratinocytes toward its own action. We identified T helper 17 (T(H)17) cells as IL-29 producers and demonstrated their ability to increase the antiviral competence of keratinocytes in an IL-29-dependent manner. Transforming growth factor-β and the activity of RORγt/RORα were most critical for the development of IL-29-producing T(H)17 cells. IL-29 secretion by these cells was dependent on NFAT and c-Jun N-terminal kinase and was inhibited by IL-4. These data suggest that T(H)17 cell-derived IL-29, which is absent in AD, mediates the robust antiviral state on psoriatic skin, and demonstrate a new function of T(H)17 cells.

Inactivated ORF virus shows antifibrotic activity and inhibits human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in preclinical models.	Inactivated orf virus (iORFV), strain D1701, is a potent immune modulator in various animal species. We recently demonstrated that iORFV induces strong antiviral activity in animal models of acute and chronic viral infections. In addition, we found D1701-mediated antifibrotic effects in different rat models of liver fibrosis. In the present study, we compare iORFV derived from two different strains of ORFV, D1701 and NZ2, respectively, with respect to their antifibrotic potential as well as their potential to induce an antiviral response controlling infections with the hepatotropic pathogens hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Both strains of ORFV showed anti-viral activity against HCV in vitro and against HBV in a transgenic mouse model without signs of necro-inflammation in vivo. Our experiments suggest that the absence of liver damage is potentially mediated by iORFV-induced downregulation of antigen cross-presentation in liver sinus endothelial cells. Furthermore, both strains showed significant anti-fibrotic activity in rat models of liver fibrosis. iORFV strain NZ2 appeared more potent compared to strain D1701 with respect to both its antiviral and antifibrotic activity on the basis of dosages estimated by titration of active virus. These results show a potential therapeutic approach against two important human liver pathogens HBV and HCV that independently addresses concomitant liver fibrosis. Further studies are required to characterize the details of the mechanisms involved in this novel therapeutic principle.

Differential influenza H1N1-specific humoral and cellular response kinetics in kidney transplant patients.	Renal transplant recipients (RTR) are considered at high risk for influenza-associated complications due to immunosuppression. The efficacy of standard influenza vaccination in RTRs is unclear. Hence, we evaluated activation of the adaptive immunity by the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 (A(H1N1)pdm09) vaccine in RTRs as compared to healthy controls. To determine cross-reactivity and/or bystander activation, seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine and tetanus/diphteria toxoid (TT/DT) vaccine-specific T cells along with allospecific T cells were quantified before and after A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination. Vaccination-induced alloimmunity was additionally determined by quantifying serum creatinine and proinflammatory protein IP-10. Contrary to healthy controls, RTRs required a booster vaccination to achieve seroconversion (13.3 % day 21; 90 % day 90). In contrast to humoral immunity, sufficient A(H1N1)pdm09-specific T-cell responses were mounted in RTRs already after the first immunization with a magnitude comparable with healthy controls. Interestingly, vaccination simultaneously boosted T cells reacting to seasonal flu but not to TT/DT, suggesting cross-activation. No alloimmune effects were recorded. In conclusion, protective antibody responses required booster vaccination. However, sufficient cellular immunity is established already after the first vaccination, demonstrating differential kinetics of humoral and cellular immunity.

TCR repertoire analysis by next generation sequencing allows complex differential diagnosis of T cell-related pathology.	Clonotype analysis is essential for complete characterization of antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, knowledge on clonal identity allows tracking of antigen-specific T cells in whole blood and tissue infiltrates and can provide information on antigenic specificity. Here, we developed a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based platform for the highly quantitative clonotype characterization of T cells and determined requirements for the unbiased characterization of the input material (DNA, RNA, ex vivo derived or cell culture expanded T cells). Thereafter we performed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis of various specimens in clinical settings including cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyomavirus BK (BKV) reactivation and acute cellular allograft rejection. Our results revealed dynamic nature of virus-specific T cell clonotypes; CMV reactivation was linked to appearance of new highly abundant antigen-specific clonalities. Moreover, analysis of clonotype overlap between BKV-, alloantigen-specific T cell-, kidney allograft- and urine-derived lymphocytes provided hints for the differential diagnosis of allograft dysfunction and enabled appropriate therapy adjustment. We believe that the established approach will provide insights into the regulation of virus-specific/anti-tumor immunity and has high diagnostic potential in the clinical routine.

Generation of highly effective and stable murine alloreactive Treg cells by combined anti-CD4 mAb, TGF-β, and RA treatment.	The transfer of alloreactive regulatory T (aTreg) cells into transplant recipients represents an attractive treatment option to improve long-term graft acceptance. We recently described a protocol for the generation of aTreg cells in mice using a nondepleting anti-CD4 antibody (aCD4). Here, we investigated whether adding TGF-β and retinoic acid (RA) or rapamycin (Rapa) can further improve aTreg-cell generation and function. Murine CD4(+) T cells were cultured with allogeneic B cells in the presence of aCD4 alone, aCD4+TGF-β+RA or aCD4+Rapa. Addition of TGF-β+RA or Rapa resulted in an increase of CD25(+)Foxp3(+)-expressing T cells. Expression of CD40L and production of IFN-γ and IL-17 was abolished in aCD4+TGF-β+RA aTreg cells. Additionally, aCD4+TGF-β+RA aTreg cells showed the highest level of Helios and Neuropilin-1 co-expression. Although CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells from all culture conditions displayed complete demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region, aCD4+TGF-β+RA Treg cells showed the most stable Foxp3 expression upon restimulation. Consequently, aCD4+TGF-β+RA aTreg cells suppressed effector T-cell differentiation more effectively in comparison to aTreg cells harvested from all other cultures, and furthermore inhibited acute graft versus host disease and especially skin transplant rejection. Thus, addition of TGF-β+RA seems to be superior over Rapa in stabilising the phenotype and functional capacity of aTreg cells.

Mechanisms and rescue strategies of calcineurin inhibitor mediated tolerance abrogation induced by anti-CD4 mAb treatment.	To ensure safety tolerance induction protocols are accompanied by conventional immunosuppressive drugs (IS). But IS such as calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), for example, cyclosporin A (CsA), can interfere with tolerance induction. We investigated the effect of an additional transient CsA treatment on anti-CD4mAb-induced tolerance induction upon rat kidney transplantation. Additional CsA treatment induced deteriorated graft function, resulting in chronic rejection characterized by glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and vascular changes. Microarray analysis revealed enhanced intragraft expression of the B cell attracting chemokine CXCL13 early during CsA treatment. Increase in CXCL13 expression is accompanied by enhanced B cell infiltration with local and systemic IgG production and C3d deposition as early as 5 days upon CsA withdrawal. Adding different CNIs to cultures of primary mesangial cells isolated from glomeruli resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in CXCL13 transcription. CsA in synergy with TNF-α can enhance the B cell attracting and activating potential of mesangial cells. Transient B cell depletion or transfer of splenocytes from tolerant recipients 3 weeks after transplantation could rescue tolerance induction and did inhibit intragraft B cell accumulation, alloantibody production and ameliorate chronic rejection.

Immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stromal cells revisited in the context of inflammatory cardiomyopathy.	Myocarditis is a common inflammatory cardiomyopathy, associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which can lead to chronic left ventricular dysfunction. Under conventional heart failure therapy, inflammatory cardiomyopathy typically has a progressive course, indicating a need for alternative therapeutic strategies to improve long-term outcomes. Experimental and clinical studies consistently support the application of cellular transplantation as a strategy to improve myocardial function. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) mediate distinct paracrine effects supporting endogenous regeneration, but most important are their remarkable immunoregulatory properties. In this review, an overview of current knowledge on immunopathology in myocarditis will be given. Furthermore, current research regarding the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs in the context of myocarditis will be discussed. Finally, the impact of MSC priming by the environment on their functionality and the advantages of systemic administration of MSCs under myocarditis are outlined.

Addition of Mn to Ge quantum dot surfaces--interaction with the Ge QD {105} facet and the Ge(001) wetting layer.	The interaction of Mn with Ge quantum dots (QD), which are bounded by {105} facets, and the strained Ge wetting layer (WL), terminated by a (001) surface, is investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These surfaces constitute the growth surfaces in the growth of Mn-doped QDs. Mn is deposited on the Ge QD and WL surface in sub-monolayer concentrations, and subsequently annealed up to a temperature of 400 ° C. The changes in bonding and surface topography are measured with STM during the annealing process. Mn forms flat islands on the Ge{105} facet, whose shape and position are guided by the rebonded step reconstruction of the facet. Voltage-dependent STM images reflect the Mn-island interaction with the empty and filled states of the Ge{105} reconstruction. Scanning tunneling spectra (STS) of the Ge{105} facet and as-deposited Mn-islands show a bandgap of 0.8 eV, and the Mn-island spectra are characterized by an additional empty state at about 1.4 eV. A statistical analysis of Mn-island shape and position on the QD yields a slight preference for edge positions, whereas the QD strain field does not impact Mn-island position. However, the formation of ultra-small Mn-clusters dominates on the Ge(001) WL, which is in contrast to Mn interaction with unstrained Ge(001) surfaces. Annealing to T < 160 °C leaves the Mn-clusters on the WL unchanged, while the Mn-islands on the Ge{105} facet undergo first a ripening process, followed by a volume gain which can be attributed to the onset of intermixing with Ge. This development is supported by the statistical analysis of island volume, size and size distribution. Increasing the annealing temperature to 220° and finally 375 ° C leads to a rapid increase in the Mn-surface diffusion, as evidenced by the formation of larger, nanometer size clusters, which are identified as germanide Mn5Ge3 from a mass balance analysis. This reaction is accompanied by the disappearance of the original Mn-surface structures and de-wetting of Mn is complete. This study unravels the details of Mn-Ge interactions, and demonstrates the role of surface diffusion as a determinant in the growth of Mn-doped Ge materials. Surface doping of Ge-nanostructures at lower temperatures could provide a pathway to control magnetism in the Mn-Ge system.	Journal of physics.

Expansion of memory-type CD8+ T cells correlates with the failure of early immunosuppression withdrawal after cadaver liver transplantation using high-dose ATG induction and rapamycin.	"We report on a pilot study investigating the feasibility of early immunosuppression withdrawal after liver transplantation (LT) using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) induction and rapamycin.
LT recipients received 3.75 mg/kg per day ATG from days 0 to 5 followed by rapamycin-based immunosuppression. In the absence of acute rejection (AR), rapamycin was withdrawn after month 4. Immunomonitoring included analysis of peripheral T-cell phenotypes and clonality, cytokine production in mixed lymphocyte reaction, and characterization of intragraft infiltrating cells.
Ten patients were enrolled between October 2009 and July 2010. In the first three patients, complete withdrawal of immunosuppression after month 4 led to AR. No further withdrawals of immunosuppressive were attempted. Two AR occurred in the remaining seven patients. ATG induced profound T-cell depletion followed by CD8(+) T-cell reexpansion exhibiting memory/effector-like phenotype associated with progressive oligoclonal T-cell expansion (Vβ/HPRT ratio) and gradually enhanced anti-cytomegalovirus and anti-Epstein-Barr virus T-cell frequencies. Patients developing AR were characterized by decreased TCAIM expression. AR were associated with increased donor-specific production of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17, increased intragraft expression of IFN-γ mRNA, and significant CD8(+) T-cell infiltrates colocalizing with IL-17(+) cells.
High-dose ATG followed by short-term rapamycin treatment failed to promote early operational tolerance to LT. AR correlates with expansion of memory-type CD8(+) T cells and increased levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 in mixed lymphocyte reaction and in the graft. This suggests that resistance and preferential expansion of effector memory T-cell in lymphopenic environment could represent the major barrier for establishment of tolerance to LT in approaches using T-cell-depleting induction."

Prospective assessment of antidonor cellular alloreactivity is a tool for guidance of immunosuppression in kidney transplantation.	Current characterization of the immune risk in renal transplant patients is only focused on the assessment of preformed circulating alloantibodies; however, alloreactive memory T cells are key players in mediating allograft rejection. Immune monitoring of antidonor alloreactive memory/effector T cells using an IFN-γ Elispot has been shown to distinguish patients at risk for immune-mediated graft dysfunction, suggesting a potential tool for immunosuppression individualization. In this nonrandomized study, we prospectively assessed donor and nondonor T-cell alloreactivity in 60 highly alloreactive patients receiving calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression and in non-T-cell alloreactive transplant recipients treated with a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen. The impact was evaluated using 1-year allograft outcome. We found a strong association between ongoing antidonor T-cell alloreactivity and histological lesions of acute T cell-mediated rejection in 6-month protocol biopsies, distinguishing those patients with better 1-year graft function, regardless of immunosuppression regimen. Interestingly, evidence for enhanced immune regulation, driven by circulating Foxp3-demethylated regulatory T cells, was only observed among patients achieving antidonor T-cell hyporesponsiveness. Thus, prospective evaluation of donor-specific T-cell sensitization may add crucial information on the alloimmune state of transplanted patients to be used in daily clinical practice.

Cross-validation of IFN-γ Elispot assay for measuring alloreactive memory/effector T cell responses in renal transplant recipients.	Assessment of donor-specific alloreactive memory/effector T cell responses using an IFN-γ Elispot assay has been suggested to be a novel immune-monitoring tool for evaluating the cellular immune risk in renal transplantation. Here, we report the cross-validation data of the IFN-γ Elispot assay performed within different European laboratories taking part of the EU RISET consortium. For this purpose, development of a standard operating procedure (SOP), comparisons of lectures of IFN-γ plates assessing intra- and interlaboratory assay variability of allogeneic or peptide stimuli in both healthy and kidney transplant individuals have been the main objectives. We show that the use of a same SOP and count-settings of the Elispot bioreader allow low coefficient variation between laboratories. Frozen and shipped samples display slightly lower detectable IFN-γ frequencies than fresh samples. Importantly, a close correlation between different laboratories is obtained when measuring high frequencies of antigen-specific primed/memory T cell alloresponses. Interestingly, significant high donor-specific alloreactive T cell responses can be similarly detected among different laboratories in kidney transplant patients displaying histological patterns of acute T cell mediated rejection. In conclusion, assessment of circulating alloreactive memory/effector T cells using an INF-γ Elispot assay can be accurately achieved using the same SOP, Elispot bioreader and experienced technicians in kidney transplantation.

Immunological properties of extraembryonic human mesenchymal stromal cells derived from gestational tissue.	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been isolated from many tissues, including gestational tissue. To date, a study comparing the properties and suitability of these cells in cell-based therapies is lacking. In this study, we compared the phenotype, proliferation rate, migration, immunogenicity, and immunomodulatory capabilities of human MSCs derived from umbilical cord lining (CL-MSCs), umbilical cord blood (CB-MSCs), placenta (P-MSCs), and Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSCs). Differences were noted in differentiation, proliferation, and migration, with CL-MSCs showing the highest proliferation and migration rates resulting in prolonged survival in immunodeficient mice. Moreover, CL-MSCs showed a prolongation in survival in xenogeneic BALB/c mice, which was attributed to their ability to dampen TH1 and TH2 responses. Weaker human cellular immune responses were detected against CL-MSCs and P-MSCs, which were correlated with their lower HLA I expression. Furthermore, HLA II was upregulated less substantially by CL-MSCs and CB-MSCs after IFN-γ stimulation. MSC types did not differ in indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression after IFN-γ stimulation. Despite their lower IDO, HLA-G, and TGF-β1 expression, only CL-MSCs were able to reduce the release of IFN-γ by lymphocytes in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In summary, CL-MSCs showed the best characteristics for cell-based strategies, as they are hypo-immunogenic and show high proliferation and migration rates. In addition, these studies show for the first time that although immunomodulatory molecules HLA-G, HLA-E, and TGF-β play an important role in MSC immune evasion, basal and induced HLA expression seems to be decisive in determining the immunogenicity of MSCs.

Impaired thymic function and CD4+ T lymphopenia, but not mannose-binding lectin deficiency, are risk factors for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients.	Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) incidence is increasing in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), but risk factors remain poorly defined. CD4+ T lymphopenia and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency are common immunodeficiencies in KTR. Here, we investigated whether CD4+ T lymphopenia and/or MBL deficiency would be risk factors for PCP in KTR. Furthermore, the role of thymic function in CD4+ T lymphopenia and outcome was studied by assessing CD45RA+CD31+CD4+ T cell numbers (RTE, recent thymus emigrants). In 321 de novo KTR serial determinations of peripheral T lymphocyte subsets (n=281, mean 4.2 times between days 0-365) and/or MBL levels (n=112, mean 1.8 times between days 30-180) were performed. 22/321 patients developed a PCP episode on average at day 199 (107-398) post-Tx. Age correlated inversely with RTE, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts until day 180 post-Tx. RTE correlated with CD4+ T-cell counts at all time-points pre- and post-Tx. PCP patients had more CMV infections (p=0.045) within the first 3 months compared to controls. Importantly, PCP patients were older (p=0.008), and had lower RTE (p=0.046) pretransplant, and lower CD4+ T-cell counts pretransplant (p=0.017), at day 60 (p=0.032) and for the average of all post-Tx values (p=0.027) compared to controls. Though treatment with T-cell depleting antibodies was associated with consecutive CD4+ T lymphopenia in the whole cohort, the number of patients who received T-cell depleting antibodies was comparable between PCP and control patients (p=0.754). A multivariate stepwise logistic regression model identified only pretransplant CD4+ T-cell counts (OR 0.011, p=0.010) and acute rejection (OR 4.66, p=0.023) as predictors of PCP. In contrast, MBL levels and incidence of MBL deficiency (<500 ng/ml) at days 30, 90 and 180 post-Tx were not different between PCP patients and controls. In conclusion, PCP risk was associated with higher age and related to both thymic functional impairment and long-lasting CD4+ T-lymphopenia that started already before transplantation. Despite frequent occurrences in KTR, low levels of serum MBL were not associated with increased risk for PCP. CD4+ T-cell counts and function should be addressed in prospective studies for more individualized approaches to PCP prophylaxis.

Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) manufacturing of advanced therapy medicinal products: a novel tailored model for optimizing performance and estimating costs.	"Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) have gained considerable attention in academia due to their therapeutic potential. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) principles ensure the quality and sterility of manufacturing these products. We developed a model for estimating the manufacturing costs of cell therapy products and optimizing the performance of academic GMP-facilities.
The ""Clean-Room Technology Assessment Technique"" (CTAT) was tested prospectively in the GMP facility of BCRT, Berlin, Germany, then retrospectively in the GMP facility of the University of California-Davis, California, USA. CTAT is a two-level model: level one identifies operational (core) processes and measures their fixed costs; level two identifies production (supporting) processes and measures their variable costs. The model comprises several tools to measure and optimize performance of these processes. Manufacturing costs were itemized using adjusted micro-costing system.
CTAT identified GMP activities with strong correlation to the manufacturing process of cell-based products. Building best practice standards allowed for performance improvement and elimination of human errors. The model also demonstrated the unidirectional dependencies that may exist among the core GMP activities. When compared to traditional business models, the CTAT assessment resulted in a more accurate allocation of annual expenses. The estimated expenses were used to set a fee structure for both GMP facilities. A mathematical equation was also developed to provide the final product cost.
CTAT can be a useful tool in estimating accurate costs for the ATMPs manufactured in an optimized GMP process. These estimates are useful when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of these novel interventions."

Terminally differentiated CD8⁺ T cells negatively affect bone regeneration in humans.	There is growing evidence that adaptive immunity contributes to endogenous regeneration processes: For example, endogenous bone fracture repair is modulated by T cells even in the absence of infection. Because delayed or incomplete fracture healing is associated with poor long-term outcomes and high socioeconomic costs, we investigated the relationship between an individual's immune reactivity and healing outcome. Our study revealed that delayed fracture healing significantly correlated with enhanced levels of terminally differentiated CD8(+) effector memory T (TEMRA) cells (CD3(+)CD8(+)CD11a(++)CD28(-)CD57(+) T cells) in peripheral blood. This difference was long lasting, reflecting rather the individual's immune profile in response to lifelong antigen exposure than a post-fracture reaction. Moreover, CD8(+) TEMRA cells were enriched in fracture hematoma; these cells were the major producers of interferon-γ/tumor necrosis factor-α, which inhibit osteogenic differentiation and survival of human mesenchymal stromal cells. Accordingly, depletion of CD8(+) T cells in a mouse osteotomy model resulted in enhanced endogenous fracture regeneration, whereas a transfer of CD8(+) T cells impaired the healing process. Our data demonstrate the high impact of the individual adaptive immune profile on endogenous bone regeneration. Quantification of CD8(+) TEMRA cells represents a potential marker for the prognosis of the healing outcome and opens new opportunities for early and targeted intervention strategies.

The genetic predisposition of natural killer cell to BK virus-associated nephropathy in renal transplant patients.	BK virus (BKV) infection represents a serious complication in renal transplant patients resulting in BKV-associated nephropathy and subsequent allograft loss. Natural killer cells are crucial in the antiviral immune response; however, an understanding of the role of natural killer cells in protection against BKV is limited. To elucidate whether killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and their interaction between donor-/recipient-related ligands have a role in BKV infection, we performed genotyping analysis in 48 kidney transplant recipients with a history of severe BKV infection/BKV-associated nephropathy and 110 recipients with stable renal function and no BKV reactivation. Of interest, we found that telomeric gene content motif was significantly associated with severe course of BKV infection/BKV-associated nephropathy and detected significantly higher percentage of patients with BKV-associated nephropathy carrying low numbers of activating receptors compared with the control group. Detailed analysis of each single receptor revealed significantly lower frequencies of the activating receptor KIR3DS1 in patients with BKV infection/nephropathy as compared with the controls. Thus, our study supports protective effects of activating receptors in BKV infection and suggest natural killer-cell-related genetic predisposition to the development of BKV-associated nephropathy.

Adiponectin modulates NK-cell function.	Adiponectin (APN) has been shown to exert antiinflammatory effects in various disease models but little is known concerning its regulation of NK-cell function. Here, we show that the majority of human CD56(dim) NK cells express surface Adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) 1 and 2 while most CD56(high) NK cells are AdipoR-negative. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-induced IFN-γ production was diminished by APN while it had no influence on NK-cell cytotoxicity. In contrast only a small subpopulation of murine NK cells expresses surface AdipoRs, but about 90% store them intracellularly. APN-deficient knockout (KO) mice had elevated frequencies of NK cells. However, cytotoxic degranulation of NK cells was decreased in APN knockout (APN-KO) animals. Accordingly, frequencies of CD11b(high) CD27(high) and CD94(high) effector NK cells and expression of NKG2D were lower in APN-KO mice. Upon CVB3 infection NK-cell function was restored in APN-KO mice. Our data suggest that in addition to its antiinflammatory effects APN also influences the numerical and differentiation status of NK cells, which may further impact the outcome of immune-mediated diseases in APN-KO mice.

HCMV-specific T-cell therapy: do not forget supply of help.	Human cytomegalovirus infections have a major negative effect on morbidity and mortality of immunosuppressed allograft recipients and indirectly on graft function and survival. The adoptive antiviral T-cell therapy is a novel therapeutic tool to restore immune competence after solid organ transplantation. Till now, the antiviral T-cell products mainly focused on cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, whereas CD4(+) T cells played a minor role. Here, we demonstrate the importance of CD4(+) T cells within T-cell lines specific for human cytomegalovirus besides its essential support for the quality of CD8(+) T-cell memory. Virus-specific CD4(+) T cells elicit profound functionality after rechallenge (multicytokine secretors, CD137, CD154, and CD107a expression and killing of infected target cells). The CD4(+) T cells show predominantly a Th1 phenotype with cytolytic properties that is mainly perforin-dependent. The data demonstrate the significance of CD4(+) T cells within T-cell products to achieve a successful adoption with enhanced efficacy.

Combined anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy and DMARD therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients reduces inflammatory gene expression in whole blood compared to DMARD therapy alone.	"Periodic assessment of gene expression for diagnosis and monitoring in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may provide a readily available and useful method to detect subclinical disease progression and follow responses to therapy with disease modifying anti-rheumatic agents (DMARDs) or anti-TNF-α therapy. We used quantitative real-time PCR to compare peripheral blood gene expression profiles in active (""unstable"") RA patients on DMARDs, stable RA patients on DMARDs, and stable RA patients treated with a combination of a disease-modifying anti-rheumatoid drug (DMARD) and an anti-TNF-α agent (infliximab or etanercept) to healthy human controls. The expression of 48 inflammatory genes were compared between healthy controls (N = 122), unstable DMARD patients (N = 18), stable DMARD patients (N = 26), and stable patients on combination therapy (N = 20).

Compared to healthy controls, patients with unstable RA on DMARDs exhibited increased expression of 25 genes, stable DMARD patients exhibited increased expression of 14 genes and decreased expression of five genes, and combined therapy patients exhibited increased expression of six genes and decreased expression of 10 genes. These findings demonstrate that active RA is associated with increased expression of circulating inflammatory markers whereas increases in inflammatory gene expression are diminished in patients with stable disease on either DMARD or anti-TNF-α therapy. Furthermore, combination DMARD and anti-TNF-α therapy is associated with greater reductions in circulating inflammatory gene expression compared to DMARD therapy alone. These results suggest that assessment of peripheral blood gene expression may prove useful to monitor disease progression and response to therapy."

B-cell-related biomarkers of tolerance are up-regulated in rejection-free kidney transplant recipients.	"Molecular signatures have recently been identified in operationally tolerant long-term kidney transplant patients; however, their expression in patients on immunosuppression remains unclear.
In this prospective study, the gene expression profiles of eight selected tolerance-associated genes (MS4A1, CD79B, TCL1A, TMEM176B, FOXP3, TOAG-1, MAN1A1, and TLR5) in the peripheral blood of 67 kidney transplant recipients at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, 90, and at 6 and 12 months, and in graft biopsies were measured. Similarly, using flow cytometry, CD45CD19CD3 B-cell counts were evaluated in the follow-up. Expression patterns were compared among patients with biopsy-proven acute rejection, borderline changes, and in rejection-free patients. A generalized linear mixed model with gamma distribution for repeated measures adjusted for induction therapy was used for statistical analysis of longitudinal data and Kruskal-Wallis test for case biopsy data.
Compared to patients with rejection, a significantly higher number of peripheral B cells were observed during follow-up in rejection-free patients and in patients with borderline changes. Gene expression patterns of MS4A1 (CD20), TCL1A, CD79B, TOAG-1, and FOXP3 genes were significantly higher in rejection-free patients as compared to rejection group with the highest differences during the first 3 months. In contrast, TMEM176B (TORID) was up-regulated in the rejection group. Similar trends were also observed between patients with borderline changes and acute rejection. Higher intragraft expression of TOAG-1 was observed in rejection-free patients.
These observations suggest an association of B-cell signatures, seen also in drug-free tolerant patients, with controlled alloimmune response."

Prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection after renal transplantation by cranberry juice and L-methionine.	"Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) increase mortality and reduce graft survival after renal transplantation. Strategies to prevent recurrent UTIs include L-methionine, cranberry juice, and antibiotics. Data on the efficacy of cranberry and L-methionine, however, are controversial in the general population; there are few data in renal transplant recipients.
We performed a retrospective analysis of 82 transplant recipients with recurrent UTIs, who underwent prophylaxis with cranberry juice (2 × 50 mL/d, n = 39, 47.6%), or L-methionine (3 × 500 mg/d, n = 25, 30.5%), or both modalities (n = 18, 21.9%). Thirty patients without prophylaxis served as controls. We analyzed symptoms, pyuria/nitrituria, and incidence of UTI events during 1 year before versus after initiation of prophylaxis.
Prophylaxis highly significantly decreased the annual UTI incidence by 58.3% (P < .001) in the study population with no change in the control group (P = .85); in addition, 53.7% of symptomatic patients reported relief of symptoms and pyuria/nitrituria disappeared in 42.4% of the dipstick-positive patients (P < .001 each). Cranberry reduced the annual number of UTI episodes by 63.9% from 3.6 ± 1.4 to 1.3 ± 1.3/year (P < .001) and L-methionine by 48.7% from 3.9 ± 1.8 to 2.0 ± 1.3/year (P < .001).

Therapeutic immunomodulation using a virus--the potential of inactivated orf virus.	Viruses can manipulate the immune response against them by various strategies to influence immune cells, i.e. by over-activation leading to functional inactivation, bypassing antigen presentation or even suppression of effector functions. Little is known, however, about how these features of immune regulation and modulation could be used for therapeutic purposes. Reasons for this include the complexity of immune regulatory mechanisms under certain disease conditions and the risks that infections with viruses pose to human beings. The orf virus (ORFV), a member of the Parapoxvirus genus of the poxvirus family, is known as a common pathogen in sheep and goats worldwide. The inactivated ORFV, however, has been used as a preventative as well as therapeutic immunomodulator in veterinary medicine in different species. Here, we review the key results obtained in pre-clinical studies or clinical studies in veterinary medicine to characterise the therapeutic potential of inactivated ORFV. Inactivated ORFV has strong effects on cytokine secretion in mice and human immune cells, leading to an auto-regulated loop of initial up-regulation of inflammatory and Th1-related cytokines, followed by Th2-related cytokines that attenuate immunopathology. The therapeutic potential of inactivated ORFV has been recognised in several difficult-to-treat disease areas, such as chronic viral diseases, liver fibrosis or various forms of cancer. Further research will be required in order to evaluate the full beneficial potential of inactivated ORFV for therapeutic immunomodulation.

The lymphocyte transformation test for borrelia detects active lyme borreliosis and verifies effective antibiotic treatment.	Borrelia-specific antibodies are not detectable until several weeks after infection and even if they are present, they are no proof of an active infection. Since the sensitivity of culture and PCR for the diagnosis or exclusion of borreliosis is too low, a method is required that detects an active Borrelia infection as early as possible. For this purpose, a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) using lysate antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii and recombinant OspC was developed and validated through investigations of seronegative and seropositive healthy individuals as well as of seropositive patients with clinically manifested borreliosis. The sensitivity of the LTT in clinical borreliosis before antibiotic treatment was determined as 89,4% while the specificity was 98,7%. In 1480 patients with clinically suspected borreliosis, results from serology and LTT were comparable in 79.8% of cases. 18% were serologically positive and LTT-negative. These were mainly patients with borreliosis after antibiotic therapy. 2.2% showed a negative serology and a positive LTT result. Half of them had an early erythema migrans. Following antibiotic treatment, the LTT became negative or borderline in patients with early manifestations of borreliosis, whereas in patients with late symptoms, it showed a regression while still remaining positive. Therefore, we propose the follow-up monitoring of dis-seminated Borrelia infections as the main indication for the Borrelia-LTT.

Crosstalk between immune cells and mesenchymal stromal cells in a 3D bioreactor system.	"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), known for their high immune modulatory capacity are promising tools for several cell-based therapies. To better mimic the in vivo situation of MSC interactions with immune cells, we applied an artificial lymph node (ALN)-bioreactor culture system combining a miniaturized perfusion bioreactor with a 3D matrix-based cell culture of immune competent cells forming micro-organoids.
Rat lymph node cells and allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs were seeded in a 20:1 ratio within the agarose matrix of the ALN-reactor. Lymphocytes were pre-incubated with Concanavalin A (ConA) and then co-cultured with MSC in the matrix with additional ConA in the perfusing medium. Live/dead staining showed survival of the co-cultures during the 8-day ALN-reactor run. Paraffin sections of bioreactor matrices were analyzed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-specific stai-ning to determine MSC proliferation. Immune modulatory capacity was defined by daily analysis of cytokine secretion profiles (TNFa, IFNy, IL-1a, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40/p70, GM-CSF).
Cytokine peak secretion at day 2 was significantly inhibited by MSCs for TNFa (96.8 ± 4.8%) and IFNy (88.7 ± 12.0%) in 3D co-cultures. In contrast, other cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12) were induced. Furthermore, we detected a significantly higher (58.8%) fraction of proliferating MSCs in the presence of immune cells compared to control bioreactors loaded with MSCs only.
In the future, this system might be an excellent tool to investigate the mechanisms of MSC-mediated immune modulation during simulated in vivo conditions."

Inactivated Orf virus (Parapoxvirus ovis) elicits antifibrotic activity in models of liver fibrosis.	"Inactivated Orf virus (ORFV, Parapoxvirus ovis) demonstrates strong antiviral activity in animal models including a human hepatitis B virus (HBV)-transgenic mouse. In addition, expression of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin-10 (IL-10) was induced after administration of inactivated ORFV in these mice. IFN-γ and IL-10 are known to elicit antifibrotic activity. We therefore aimed to study antifibrotic activity of inactivated ORFV in models of liver fibrosis.
We characterized ORFV-induced hepatic cytokine expression in rats. We then studied ORFV in two models of liver fibrosis in rats, pig serum-induced liver fibrosis and carbon tetrachloride (CCL4 )-induced liver fibrosis.
ORFV induced hepatic expression of IFN-γ and IL-10 in rats. ORFV mediated antifibrotic activity when administrated concomitantly with the fibrosis-inducing agents in both models of liver fibrosis. Importantly, when CCL4 -induced liver fibrosis was already established, ORFV application still showed significant antifibrotic activity. In addition, we were able to demonstrate a direct antifibrotic effect of ORFV on stellate cells.
These results establish a potential novel antifibrotic therapeutic approach that not only prevents but also resolves established liver fibrosis. Further studies are required to unravel the details of the mechanisms involved."

The phenotypic distribution and functional profile of tuberculin-specific CD4 T-cells characterizes different stages of TB infection.	"Recent publications have suggested that altered proportions of functional CD4 T-cell subsets correlate with active pulmonary TB. Also, CD27-expression on tuberculin-activated IFN-γ(+) CD4 T-cells is known to differ significantly between patients with active pulmonary TB and healthy TB-unexposed BCG vaccinees. Here, we explore links between CD4 T-cell phenotype, multiple functional subsets, and control of TB.
We examined ex-vivo overnight tuberculin activated CD4 T-cells in regards to CD27-expression and the activation markers, CD154 upregulation, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, and degranulation in 44 individuals, including cases of clinically active pulmonary TB, and hospital staff with prolonged TB exposure, some of whom had latent TB.
Active pulmonary TB generally showed an excess of TNF-α(+) subsets over IFN-γ(+) subsets, paralleled by decreased CD27 expression on activated IFN-γ(+) or CD154(+) CD4 T-cells. The single subset distinguishing best between active pulmonary TB and high TB exposure was CD154(+) /TNF-α(+) / IFN-γ(-) /IL-2(-) /degranulation(-) (AUROC 0.90). The ratio between the frequencies of TNF-α(+) /IFN-γ(+) CD4 T-cells was an effective alternative parameter (AUROC 0.87).
Functional subsets and phenotype of tuberculin induced CD4 T-cells differ between stages of TB infection. Predominance of TNF-α(+) CD4 T-cells in active infection suggests an increased effort of the immune system to contain disease."	Cytometry.

Blockage of heme oxygenase-1 abrogates the protective effect of regulatory T cells on murine pregnancy and promotes the maturation of dendritic cells.	Regulatory T cells (Treg) play an important role in fetal protection. They expand during normal pregnancy and protect fetal antigens from maternal effector cells. Their effect is associated with the up-regulation of tolerance-associated molecules at the fetal-maternal interface. Among these, Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1, coded by Hmox1) is of special importance as its blockage correlates with increased abortion rates and its up-regulation positively affects pregnancy outcome. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the protective effect of Treg is mediated by HO-1 in a mouse model. HO-1 blockage by Zinc Protoporhyrin (ZnPPIX) abrogated the protective effect of Treg transfer. We found that HO-1 is important in maintaining maternal dendritic cells (DCs) in an immature state, which contributes to the expansion of the peripheral Treg population. This brings to light one essential pathway through which Treg mediates the semi-allogeneic fetus tolerance.

Induction of allograft tolerance by monoclonal CD3 antibodies: a matter of timing.	Despite remarkable progress in organ transplantation through the development of a wealth of immunosuppressive drugs highly effective at controlling acute rejection, two major problems still remain, the loss of transplants due to chronic rejection and the growing number of sensitized recipients due to previous transplants, transfusions or pregnancies. Induction of immune tolerance appears to be the only way to curb this complex situation. Here we describe that a therapy, already successfully used to restore immune tolerance to self-antigens in overt autoimmunity, is effective at promoting transplant tolerance. We demonstrate that a short low-dose course with CD3 antibodies started after transplantation, at the time of effector T cell priming to alloantigens, induces permanent acceptance of fully mismatched islet allografts. Mechanistic studies revealed that antigen-specific regulatory and effector T cells are differentially affected by the treatment. CD3 antibody treatment preferentially induces apoptosis of activated alloreactive T cells which is mandatory for tolerance induction. In contrast, regulatory T cells are relatively spared from CD3 antibody-induced depletion and can transfer antigen-specific tolerance thus arguing for their prominent role in sustaining long-term graft survival.

Detrimental effects of rat mesenchymal stromal cell pre-treatment in a model of acute kidney rejection.	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have shown immunomodulatory and tissue repair potential including partial tolerance induction by pre-treatment of donor-specific cells in a rat heart transplantation model. Very recently, we could show that autologous MSC attenuated ischemia reperfusion injury in a highly mismatched donor-recipient rat kidney transplant model. Therefore, we investigated donor-specific MSC pre-treatment in this rat kidney transplantation model to study whether graft function could be improved, or if tolerance could be induced. Donor- and recipient-type MSC or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control was injected i.v. 4 days before kidney transplantation. Mycophenolate mofetil immunosuppression (20mg/kg body weight) was applied for 7 days. Kidney grafts and spleens were harvested between days 8 and 10 and analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistology. In addition, creatinine levels in the blood were measured and serum was screened for the presence of donor-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, application of both donor- and recipient-specific MSC resulted in enhanced humoral immune responses verified by intragraft B cell infiltration and complement factor C4d deposits. Moreover, signs of inflammation and rejection were generally enhanced in both MSC-treated groups relative to PBS control group. Additionally, pre-treatment with donor-specific MSC significantly enhanced the level of donor-specific antibody formation when compared with PBS- or recipient MSC-treated groups. Pre-treatment with both MSC types resulted in a higher degree of kidney cortex tissue damage and elevated creatinine levels at the time point of rejection. Thus, MSC pre-sensitization in this model impairs the allograft outcome. Our data from this pre-clinical kidney transplantation model indicate that pre-operative MSC administration may not be optimal in kidney transplantation and caution must be exerted before moving forward with clinical studies in order to avoid adverse effects.

Variation in inflammatory/regulatory cytokines in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary challenges with dengue virus.	Secondary heterologous dengue infection is a risk factor for severe disease manifestations because of the immune-enhancement phenomenon. Succeeding clinical infections are seldom reported, and the clinical course of tertiary and quaternary dengue infections is not clear. Cuba represents a unique environment to study tertiary/quaternary dengue infections in a population with known clinical and serologic dengue markers and no dengue endemicity. We took advantage of this exceptional epidemiologic condition to study the effect of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary dengue infection exposure on the expression of pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, critical in dengue infection pathogenesis, by using a dengue infection ex vivo model. Whereas secondary exposure induced a high cytokine response, we found a significantly lower expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin-10, and tumor growth factor-β after tertiary and quaternary infectious challenge. Significant differences in expression of the cytokines were seen between the dengue immune profiles, suggesting that the sequence in which the immune system encounters serotypes may be important in determining the nature of the immune response to subsequent infections.

Permanent CNI treatment for prevention of renal allograft rejection in sensitized hosts can be replaced by regulatory T cells.	Recent data suggest that donor-specific memory T cells (T(mem)) are an independent risk factor for rejection and poor graft function in patients and a major challenge for immunosuppression minimizing strategies. Many tolerance induction protocols successfully proven in small animal models e.g. costimulatory blockade, T cell depletion failed in patients. Consequently, there is a need for more predictive transplant models to evaluate novel promising strategies, such as adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (Treg). We established a clinically more relevant, life-supporting rat kidney transplant model using a high responder (DA to LEW) recipients that received donor-specific CD4(+)/ 8(+) GFP(+) T(mem) before transplantation to achieve similar pre-transplant frequencies of donor-specific T(mem) as seen in many patients. T cell depletion alone induced long-term graft survival in naïve recipients but could not prevent acute rejection in T(mem)(+) rats, like in patients. Only if T cell depletion was combined with permanent CNI-treatment, the intragraft inflammation, and acute/chronic allograft rejection could be controlled long-term. Remarkably, combining 10 days CNI treatment and adoptive transfer of Tregs (day 3) but not Treg alone also induced long-term graft survival and an intragraft tolerance profile (e.g. high TOAG-1) in T(mem)(+) rats. Our model allows evaluation of novel therapies under clinically relevant conditions.

Conversion from cyclosporine to everolimus at 4.5 months posttransplant: 3-year results from the randomized ZEUS study.	The long-term effect of conversion from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) therapy to an mTOR inhibitor requires clarification. Following completion of the 12-month, open-label, multicenter ZEUS study, in which 300 kidney transplant recipients were randomized to continue cyclosporine (CsA) or convert to everolimus at 4.5 months posttransplant, outcomes were assessed at month 36 (n = 284; 94.7%). CNI therapy was reintroduced in 28.4% of everolimus patients by month 36. The primary efficacy endpoint, estimated glomerular filtration rate (Nankivell, ANCOVA) was significantly higher with everolimus versus the CsA group at month 24 (7.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , 95%CI 4.3, 11.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ; p < 0.001) and month 36 (7.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) , 95%CI 3.6, 11.4 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ; p < 0.001). The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection from randomization to month 36 was 13.0% in the everolimus arm and 4.8% in the CsA arm (p = 0.015). Patient and graft survival, as well as incidences of malignancy, severe infections and hospitalization, were similar between groups. Kidney transplant patients who are converted from CsA to everolimus at month 4.5 and who remain on everolimus thereafter may achieve a significant improvement in renal function that is maintained to 3 years. There was a significantly higher rate of rejection in the everolimus arm but this did not exert a deleterious effect by 3 years posttransplant.

Association of TLR3-hyporesponsiveness and functional TLR3 L412F polymorphism with recurrent herpes labialis.	HSV-1 persistently infects almost 90% of our population; however, only 30% of the infected subjects suffer from recurrent herpes lesions, most frequently herpes labialis (HL). We hypothesized that variations in toll-like receptor (TLR) functions might contribute to HL susceptibility. In our study, the TLR-2/1,-3, and -7/8 responses of immune cell subsets derived from asymptomatic HSV-1 carriers were compared with responses of subjects with HL history. Remarkably, natural killer (NK) cells isolated from HL subjects showed significantly lower IFN-γ responses selectively to the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Furthermore, the TLR3 L412F genetic polymorphism was found to reduce NK cell TLR3-responsiveness and is associated with susceptibility to recurrent HL. The TLR3 response detected in HL total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), however, was not impaired, indicating restoration of NK cell TLR3-deficiency through co-stimulatory functions. In conclusion, our results suggest that decreased TLR3 response of NK cells is associated with HL susceptibility; and potentially explain why symptomatic outbreak of HL usually occurs after stress or prolonged UV light exposure, when host co-stimulatory functions are disturbed.

Cyclosporin A and tacrolimus reduce T-cell polyfunctionality but not interferon-γ responses directed at cytomegalovirus.	Cytomegalovirus (CMV) -specific immunity is often estimated by the number of in vitro CMV antigen-inducible interferon-γ-positive (IFN-γ(+) ) T cells. However, recent work indicates that simultaneous production of IFN-γ, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) (referred to as 'polyfunctionality') is more relevant for anti-viral protection. Here, we compared polyfunctionality of CMV-specific T cells (pp65 and IE-1 proteins) in 23 solid-organ transplant patients and seven healthy controls by flow cytometry. The proportions of TNF-α(+) /IFN-γ(+) /IL-2 cells among the activated cells were significantly reduced in transplant patients but not the frequencies of IFN-γ(+) CD8(+) T cells. Immunosuppression reduces polyfunctionality, which reflects the increased infection risk in this patient group.

CCN1: a novel inflammation-regulated biphasic immune cell migration modulator.	In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the effect of CCN1 on the migration of human immune cells. The molecule CCN1, produced by fibroblasts and endothelial cells, is considered as an important matrix protein promoting tissue repair and immune cell adhesion by binding various integrins. We recently reported that CCN1 therapy is able to suppress acute inflammation in vivo. Here, we show that CCN1 binds to various immune cells including T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes. The addition of CCN1 in vitro enhances both actin polymerization and transwell migration. Prolonged incubation with CCN1, however, results in the inhibition of migration of immune cells by a mechanism that involves downregulation of PI3Kγ, p38, and Akt activation. Furthermore, we observed that immune cells themselves produce constitutively CCN1 and secretion is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli. In line with this finding, patients suffering from acute inflammation had enhanced serum levels of CCN1. These findings extend the classical concept of CCN1 as a locally produced cell matrix adhesion molecule and suggest that CCN1 plays an important role in regulating immune cell trafficking by attracting and locally immobilizing immune cells.

Preferential expansion of human virus-specific multifunctional central memory T cells by partial targeting of the IL-2 receptor signaling pathway: the key role of CD4+ T cells.	Effector memory T cells are effective in controlling acute infections, but central memory T cells play a key role in long-lasting protection against viruses and tumors. In vivo/in vitro challenge by Ag commonly supports the generation of effector memory T cells with limited longevity. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time in the human system and under rechallenge conditions that targeting IL-2R by partial mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition or blocking IL-2Rα enriches human CD4(+)/CD8(+) central memory T cells within the virus-specific T cell product associated with enhanced functionality (i.e., multicytokine secretors, including IL-2; enhanced CD137 and CD107a expression on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells, respectively; and killing infected target cells). Remarkably, the effects on CD8(+) T cells are mainly mediated via the enhancement of CD4(+) T cell function. The data reveal new insights into the role of CD4(+) T cell support for the quality of CD8(+) T cell memory, even under rechallenge conditions. Moreover, our method offers a new approach to improve the long-lasting efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in patients.

Comparative pharmacokinetic study of two mycophenolate mofetil formulations in stable kidney transplant recipients.	We compared steady-state pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) - Myfenax(®) (Teva) and CellCept(®) (Roche) - in stable kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). This was an international, multi-centre, randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-sequence crossover study with a 3-month follow-up. We included KTRs at least 12 months post-transplantation with stable renal graft function for at least 3 months. The maintenance treatment consisted of MMF in combination with tacrolimus with or without steroids. At the end of the two treatment periods, 6-h or 12-h PK studies of mycophenolic acid (MPA) were performed. A total of 43 patients (mean age: 50.7 ± 13.5 years; 19 females, 24 males) were randomized. Estimates of test to reference ratios (90% CIs) were 0.959 (0.899; 1.023) h*μg/ml for AUC((0-tau)) and 0.873 (0.787; 0.968) μg/ml for C(max). Estimates for AUC((0-6h)) were 0.923 (0.865; 0.984) h*μg/ml and 0.985 (0.877; 1.106) μg/ml for C(min). Thus, AUC((0-tau)), AUC((0-6h)), and C(min) of MPA were within the predefined margins. C(max) was somewhat outside of these margins in this set of patients. The numbers and types of adverse events were not different between the two treatments. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of MPA as well as adverse events are comparable for Myfenax(®) and CellCept(®) in tacrolimus-treated stable KTRs.

Initial immune reaction and angiogenesis in bone healing.	During hematoma formation following injury, an inflammatory reaction ensues as an initial step in the healing process. As granulation tissue matures, revascularization is a prerequisite for successful healing. The hypothesis of this study was that scarless tissue reconstitution in the regenerative bone healing process is dependent on a balanced immune reaction that initiates revasculatory steps. To test this hypothesis, cellular composition and expression profiles of a bone hematoma (regenerative, scarless) was compared with a muscle soft tissue hematoma (healing with a scar) in a sheep model. Upregulation of regulatory T helper cells and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-10) coincided with an upregulation of angiogenic factors (HIF1α and HIF1α regulated genes) in the regenerative bone hematoma but not in the soft tissue hematoma. These results indicate that the timely termination of inflammation and early onset of revascularization are interdependent and essential for a regenerative healing process. Prolonged pro-inflammatory signaling occurring in a delayed bone-healing model supports the finding that timely termination of inflammation furthers the regenerative process. Differing cellular compositions are due to different cell sources invading the hematoma, determining the ensuing cytokine expression profile and thus paving the path for regenerative healing in bone or the formation of scar tissue in muscle injury.

Low-dose cyclosporine mediates donor hyporesponsiveness in a fully mismatched rat kidney transplant model.	"Tolerance induction protocols have been successfully tested in animal models, yet their compatibility with immunosuppressive drugs remains to be fully elucidated. Our own previous data have indicated that cyclosporine A (CsA) affects the balance of effector and regulatory mechanisms with low-dose CsA doses promoting hyporesponsiveness. Here, we present a fully mismatched rat kidney model in which low-dose CsA treatment induces donor hyporesponsiveness to secondary renal allografts. Lewis recipients of DA kidney grafts received low, medium or high doses of CsA × 10 days. By 30 days, the primary transplant was removed and a second transplant of donor origin was engrafted. Following low-dose CsA, but not high-dose CsA treatment of the primary recipient, secondary transplants were accepted long-term in the absence of immunosuppression. Regulatory T-cell function was unimpaired and independent of the CyA dosage. Of note, low-dose CsA significantly reduced alloantibody titers in primary recipients. Adoptive transfer of graft infiltrating cells or splenocytes from hyporesponsive recipients supported long-term acceptance of donor kidney allografts. These results demonstrate a dose-dependent and transferable ""pro-tolerogenic"" effect of low-dose CsA treatment. This model is of clinical relevance to test the interference of CsA with tolerance induction in the absence of additional immunosuppression."

Burkitt post-transplantation lymphoma in adult solid organ transplant recipients: sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab (R) followed by cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or R-CHOP is safe and effective in an analysis of 8 patients.	"Burkitt lymphoma post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (Burkitt-PTLD) is a rare form of monomorphic B-cell PTLD for which no standard treatment has been established. Currently, the treatment of Burkitt lymphoma outside the post-transplantation setting involves high doses of alkylating agents, frequent dosing, and intrathecal and/or systemic central nervous system prophylaxis. In PTLD, however, such protocols are associated with considerable toxicity and mortality.
The authors present a retrospective series of 8 adult patients with Burkitt-PTLD. Six patients were reported to the prospective German PTLD registry or were enrolled in the PTLD-1 trial, and 2 patients had received treatment before 2000, thus allowing for comparison with the pre-rituximab era.
Seven of the 8 patients were men. The median age at presentation was 38 years, and the median time since transplantation was 5.7 years. Five of 8 patients had histologically established, Epstein-Barr virus-associated disease, and 7 of 7 patients were positive for a MYC translocation. Five of 8 patients received sequential immunochemotherapy (4 courses of rituximab [R] followed by 4 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone [CHOP] or R plus CHOP [R-CHOP]). In this group, 5 of 5 patients reached complete remission (CR), and their overall survival (OS) was significantly longer (P = .008) compared with the OS for 2 of 8 patients who received first-line CHOP and did not respond. One of 8 patients (who had stage IV disease with meningiosis) received combination therapy (cyclophosphamide pretreatment, rituximab, intrathecal chemotherapy, whole-brain irradiation, and radioimmunotherapy) and reached CR. Overall, 6 of 8 patients reached CR; and, after a median follow-up of 4.7 years (range, 1.7-4.8 years), the median OS was 36.7 months. There was no treatment-related mortality under first-line therapy.
In the largest adult case series in Burkitt-PTLD to date, sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab followed by standard CHOP or R-CHOP was a both safe and effective treatment."

A NOVel ELISPOT assay to quantify HLA-specific B cells in HLA-immunized individuals.	Quantification of the humoral alloimmune response is generally achieved by measuring serum HLA antibodies, which provides no information about the cells involved in the humoral immune response. Therefore, we have developed an HLA-specific B-cell ELISPOT assay allowing for quantification of B cells producing HLA antibodies. We used recombinant HLA monomers as target in the ELISPOT assay. Validation was performed with human B-cell hybridomas producing HLA antibodies. Subsequently, we quantified B cells producing HLA antibodies in HLA-immunized individuals, non-HLA-immunized individuals and transplant patients with serum HLA antibodies. B-cell hybridomas exclusively formed spots against HLA molecules of corresponding specificity with the sensitivity similar to that found in total IgG ELISPOT assays. HLA-immunized healthy individuals showed up to 182 HLA-specific B cells per million total B cells while nonimmunized individuals had none. Patients who were immunized by an HLA-A2-mismatched graft had up to 143 HLA-A2-specific B cells per million total B cells. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a highly specific and sensitive HLA-specific B-cell ELISPOT assay, which needs further validation in a larger series of transplant patients. This technique constitutes a new tool for quantifying humoral immune responses.

Exploring the potential of low doses carbon monoxide as therapy in pregnancy complications.	 Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been shown to play a pivotal role in pregnancy outcome and its ablation leads to abnormal placentation, intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) and subsequent intrauterine fetal death. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been found to mimic the protective effects of HO-1 activity, rescuing HO-1-deficient fetuses. This gasotransmitter arises in biological systems during the oxidative catabolism of heme by HO. Here, we explored the potential of CO in preventing IUGR and established the optimal doses and therapeutic time window in a clinically relevant mouse model. We additionally investigated the pathways activated upon CO application in vivo. We established 50 ppm as the best lowest dose of CO necessary to prevent growth restriction being the optimal time frame during days 3 to 8 of mouse pregnancy. CO lead to higher fetal and placental weights and avoided fetal death without showing any pathologic effects. CO breathing further suppressed inflammatory responses, diminished placenta apoptosis and complement deposition and regulated placental angiogenesis. Our results confirm the protective role of the HO-1/CO axis and point this gas as an emerging therapeutic possibility which is worth to further explore.

Ursodeoxycholic acid in patients with chronic heart failure: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.	"This study sought to assess the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) on endothelial function and inflammatory markers in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
Endothelial dysfunction is commonly observed in patients with CHF, and it contributes to the limitation in exercise capacity that accompanies this condition. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide may trigger proinflammatory cytokine release and promote further endothelial dysfunction. UDCA, a bile acid used in the treatment of cholestatic liver disease, has anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties and may contribute to the formation of mixed micelles around lipopolysaccharide. These properties may help to improve peripheral blood flow in patients with CHF.
We performed a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of UDCA in 17 clinically stable male patients with CHF (New York Heart Association functional class II/III, left ventricular ejection fraction <45%). Patients received in random order 500 mg UDCA twice daily for 4 weeks and placebo for another 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was post-ischemic peak peripheral arm blood flow as assessed by strain-gauge plethysmography.
Sixteen patients completed the study. UDCA was well tolerated in all patients. Compared with placebo, UDCA improved peak post-ischemic blood flow in the arm (+18%, p = 0.038), and a trend for improved peak post-ischemic blood flow in the leg was found (+17%, p = 0.079). Liver function improved: compared with placebo, levels of γ-glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, and soluble tumor necrosis factor α receptor 1 were lower after treatment with UDCA than after placebo (all p < 0.05). There was no change in 6-min walk test or New York Heart Association functional class, and levels of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-6 were unchanged or increased compared with placebo.
UDCA is well tolerated in patients with CHF. UDCA improves peripheral blood flow and is associated with improved markers of liver function."

Inactivated orf virus (Parapoxvirus ovis) induces antitumoral activity in transplantable tumor models.	Orf virus (ORFV, Parapoxvirus ovis) possesses strong immunomodulating activity including the induction of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) expression. Antiviral effects have been described which appeared to be facilitated by an ORFV-induced Type 1 helper T-cell (Th1-type) immune response. In this study, we investigated the potential antitumoral activity of inactivated ORFV in transplantable tumor models. We show that parenteral administration of inactivated ORFV mediates antitumor effects in various models including the murine syngenic B16 F10 melanoma and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenograft. Inhibition of natural killer (NK) and NKT cell activity through administration of an anti-mouse NK-1.1 antibody led to a reduction of ORFV-mediated antitumoral effects. However, residual antitumoral activity was observed. This observation was confirmed in MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing NOD/LtSz-scid/j mice which not only lack functional T and B lymphocytes but, in addition, have virtually no cells positive for the NK 1.1 cell surface marker. Thus, administration of inactivated ORFV induced inhibitory effects on the growth of transplantable tumors even under conditions of severe immunosuppression.

Mannose-binding lectin deficiency is not associated with increased risk for polyomavirus nephropathy.	"Polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN) affects up to 10% of kidney transplant recipients and is a major risk factor for graft loss. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is an important recognition molecule of the innate immune system, and its deficiency has been associated with susceptibility to various infections. In transplantation, on the other hand, high MBL levels have been associated with increased tissue damage in ischemia-reperfusion models and poorer graft and patient survival in solid organ transplant patients. To investigate the relation between MBL and BK virus infection, post-transplant (post-Tx) MBL levels were determined in a cohort of de novo kidney transplant patients with and without BK viremia.
41 de novo kidney transplant patients with high (n=16, group 1) or low level BK viremia (n=25, group 2) and 64 patients without BK viremia (group 3) were included. In every patient, functional MBL levels were determined at 1-3 time points (days 30, 90 or 180) post-Tx using an MBL oligomer ELISA.
MBL levels remained unchanged between days 30 and 180 post-Tx independent of BKV viremia. Frequencies of MBL deficiency (<500 ng/mL) and MBL levels were not significantly different between the 3 groups. However, group 2 patients showed a trend towards lower MBL serum levels compared to group 1 patients, notably in patients without acute rejection (p=0.076).
MBL deficiency was not associated with higher risk for BK viremia. In contrast, we hypothesize that BK virus replication in patients with low MBL levels might imply lower risk for progression towards PVAN compared to patients with high MBL levels. This view is supported by recent data demonstrating local complement activation in BK nephropathy."

Sequential treatment with rituximab followed by CHOP chemotherapy in adult B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD): the prospective international multicentre phase 2 PTLD-1 trial.	"Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) develops in 1-10% of transplant recipients and can be Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated. To improve long-term efficacy after rituximab monotherapy and to avoid the toxic effects of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy seen in first-line treatment, we initiated a phase 2 trial to test whether the subsequent use of rituximab and CHOP would improve the outcome of patients with PTLD.
In this international multicentre open-label phase 2 trial, treatment-naive adult solid-organ transplant recipients diagnosed with CD20-positive PTLD who had failed to respond to upfront immunosuppression reduction received four courses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously) once a week followed by 4 weeks without treatment and four cycles of CHOP every 3 weeks. In case of disease progression during rituximab monotherapy, CHOP was started immediately. Supportive therapy with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor after chemotherapy was mandatory and antibiotic prophylaxis was recommended. The primary endpoint was treatment efficacy measured as response rates in all patients who completed treatment with rituximab and CHOP, per protocol, and response duration, in all patients who completed all planned therapy and responded. Secondary endpoints were frequency of infections, treatment-related mortality, and overall survival. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01458548.
74 patients were enrolled between Dec 12, 2002 and May 5, 2008, of whom 70 patients were eligible to receive treatment. PTLD was of late type in 53 (76%) of 70 patients, monomorphic in 67 (96%) of 70, and histologically EBV associated in 29 (44%) of 66 cases. Four of 70 patients did not receive CHOP. 53 of 59 patients had a complete or partial response (90%, 95% CI 79-96), of which 40 (68%, 55-78) were complete responses. At data cutoff (June 1, 2011) median response duration in the 53 patients who had responded to treatment had not yet been reached (>79·1 months). The main adverse events were grade 3-4 leucopenia in 42 of 62 patients (68%, 55-78) and infections of grade 3-4 in 26 of 64 patients (41%, 29-53). Seven of 66 patients (11%, 5-21) had CHOP-associated treatment-related mortality. Median overall survival was 6·6 years (95% CI 2·8-10·4; n=70).
Our results support the use of sequential immunochemotherapy with rituximab and CHOP in PTLD.

Vitamin A metabolism is changed in donors after living-kidney transplantation: an observational study.	"The kidneys are essential for the metabolism of vitamin A (retinol) and its transport proteins retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) and transthyretin. Little is known about changes in serum concentration after living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) as a consequence of unilateral nephrectomy; although an association of these parameters with the risk of cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance has been suggested. Therefore we analyzed the concentration of retinol, RBP4, apoRBP4 and transthyretin in serum of 20 living-kidney donors and respective recipients at baseline as well as 6 weeks and 6 months after LDKT.
As a consequence of LDKT, the kidney function of recipients was improved while the kidney function of donors was moderately reduced within 6 weeks after LDKT. With regard to vitamin A metabolism, the recipients revealed higher levels of retinol, RBP4, transthyretin and apoRBP4 before LDKT in comparison to donors. After LDKT, the levels of all four parameters decreased in serum of the recipients, while retinol, RBP4 as well as apoRBP4 serum levels of donors increased and remained increased during the follow-up period of 6 months.
LDKT is generally regarded as beneficial for allograft recipients and not particularly detrimental for the donors. However, it could be demonstrated in this study that a moderate reduction of kidney function by unilateral nephrectomy, resulted in an imbalance of components of vitamin A metabolism with a significant increase of retinol and RBP4 and apoRBP4 concentration in serum of donors."

Novel approach for improved assessment of phenotypic and functional characteristics of BKV-specific T-cell immunity.	"BKV-associated nephropathy represents a serious complication of the posttransplant period in kidney transplant recipients. Monitoring BKV-specific immunity is of a special importance for estimation of clinical course in patients with BKV reactivation. Our recent data demonstrated that all five BKV antigens are immunogenic and elicit T-cell responses varying within patients. Therefore, all five BKV proteins should be evaluated for the assessment of BKV-specific immunity. However, analysis of five proteins performed separately is time- and cost-intensive and requires large amount of blood.
Using novel approach of a mixture of overlapping peptide pools encompassing all five BKV antigens (viral protein [VP] 1, VP2, VP3, large tumor antigen, and small tumor antigen) and multiparameter flow cytometry, we evaluate BKV-specific T cells in patients with a previous/present severe long-lasting or transient BKV reactivation. Patients without BKV reactivation were used as control.
In this study, we show that using mixture of overlapping peptide pool results in the magnitude of CD4- and CD8-positive BKV-specific T-cell response, which is significantly higher compared with any frequencies detected by previously used single BKV antigen stimulation. Of interest, patients with a history of rapid BKV clearance had significantly higher frequency of multifunctional interferon gamma-γ/interleukin (IL)-2/tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-2/tumor necrosis factor-α CD4-positive T cells, suggesting protective potential of polyfunctional T cells. Furthermore, we did not find IL-17-producing BKV-specific memory T cells in patients recovered from BKV reactivation.
Here, we established a fast and sensitive approach allowing the most comprehensive assessment of the total BKV immunity performed to date and offer a new platform for further prospective studies."

Comparative study of the influence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 and ganciclovir on the cytomegalovirus-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune response.	Cytomegalovirus(CMV) reactivation causes immunopathy, graft malfunction, and even rejection. The traditional anti-CMV drug ganciclovir is not able to prevent reactivation of endogenous virus. Recent studies have found that proteasome inhibitor (PI) is able to suppress CMV replication. In this study we investigated the influence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 and ganciclovir on the CMV-specific CD8(+) T-cell immune response. We found that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in response to CMV-infected fibroblasts was reduced under the influence of MG132 in a dose-dependent manner. A marked reduction was observed at 0.5 μM. Likewise, CMV-specific cytotoxicity of CD8(+) T cells was decreased in the presence of MG132. In contrast, the traditional CMV replication inhibitor ganciclovir (10 μM) had no such effect. These findings might have important implications in reducing CMV-associated immunopathy by altering epitope generation through the application of selective proteasome inhibitors.

Cytomegalovirus-specific regulatory and effector T cells share TCR clonality--possible relation to repetitive CMV infections.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections have a major impact on morbidity and mortality of transplant patients. Among the complex antiviral T-cell response, CMV-IE-1 antigen-specific CD8+ cells are crucial for preventing CMV disease but do not protect from recurring/lasting CMV reactivation. Recently, we confirmed that adoptive transfer of autologous IE-1/pp65-specific T-cell lines was able to combat severe CMV disease; however, the control of CMV infection was only temporary. We hypothesized that CMV-induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) might be related to recurring/lasting CMV infection. In fact, kidney transplant patients with recurring CMV infections expressed enhanced suppression on CMV response. Analysis of in vitro expanded CD4+ epitope-specific cells revealed that CMV-specific CD4+CD25(high)  Treg cells functionally suppress CD25(low)  effector T cells (Teff) upon epitope-specific reactivation. Their phenotype is similar to iTreg - CD39(high) /Helios-/IL-2(low) /IFNγ(high) /IL-10±/TGFß-LAP±/FOXP3+ and methylated foxp3 locus. Remarkably, in vitro expanded CD4+CD25(high)  iTreg share the same dominant TCR-Vβ-CDR3 clones with functionally distinct CD4+CD25(low)  Teff. Moreover, the same clones were present in freshly isolated CD4+CD25(high)  and CD4+CD25(low)  T cells suggesting their in vivo generation. These findings directly demonstrate that Teff and iTreg can differentiate from one ""mother"" clone with specificity to the same viral epitope and indicate that peripheral iTreg generation is related to frequent antigen appearance."

Human leukocyte antigen I knockdown human embryonic stem cells induce host ignorance and achieve prolonged xenogeneic survival.	"Although human embryonic stem cells (hESC) have enormous potential for cell replacement therapy of heart failure, immune rejection of hESC derivatives inevitably would occur after transplantation. We therefore aimed to generate a hypoantigeneic hESC line with improved survival characteristics.
Using various in vivo, nonischemic, hindlimb xenotransplant models (immunocompetent and defined immunodefective mouse strains) as well as human in vitro T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell assays, we revealed a central role for T cells in mediating hESC rejection. The NK-cell susceptibility of hESC in vivo was found to be low, and the NK response to hESC challenge in vitro was negligible. To reduce the antigenicity of hESC, we successfully generated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) I knockdown cells (hESC(siRNA+IB)) using both HLA I RNA interference (siRNA) and intrabody (IB) technology. HLA I expression was ≈99% reduced after 7 days and remained low for weeks. Cellular immune recognition of these hESC(siRNA+IB) was strongly reduced in both xenogeneic and allogeneic settings. Immune rejection was profoundly mitigated after hESC(siRNA+IB) transplantation into immunocompetent mice, and even long-term graft survival was achieved in one third of the animals without any immunosuppression. The survival benefit of hESC(siRNA+IB) was further confirmed under ischemic conditions in a left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model.
HLA I knockdown hESC(siRNA+IB) provoke T-cell ignorance and experience largely mitigated xenogeneic rejection. By generating hypoantigeneic hESC lines, the generation of acceptable hESC derivatives may become a practical concept and push cell replacement strategies forward."

Immunomodulative efficacy of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured in human platelet lysate.	Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are considered to be a promising tool for novel cell-based therapies. Clinical applications in solid organ transplantation were hampered by the dependence on animal serum for hMSCs clinical scale expansion until substitution with human platelet lysate (HPL) became a promising alternative. Therefore we focused on a direct comparison of immunomodulatory properties of hMSCs cultured in HPL or fetal calf serum (FCS). Phenotypic characterization, detection of cytokine secretion and effects on alloantigen- and mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation as well as degranulation of cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T cells were applied in potency assays. We demonstrated that HPL-cultured MSCs have comparable immunomodulatory capacities to their FCS-cultured counterparts. The observed immunomodulatory properties include a beneficial inhibitory effect on immune cell proliferation and an unaffected viral T cell immunity. Thus, culturing hMSCs in HPL generates an efficient and safe expansion combined with intriguing immunomodulatory properties making these cells an attractive cell therapeutic tool.

In vivo effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in a rat kidney transplantation model with prolonged cold ischemia.	Brain death and prolonged cold ischemia are major contributors to the poorer long-term outcome of transplants from deceased donor kidney transplants, with an even higher impact if expanded criteria donors ('marginal organs') are used. Targeting ischemia-reperfusion injury-related intragraft inflammation is an attractive concept to improve the outcome of those grafts. As mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) express both immunomodulatory and tissue repair properties, we evaluated their therapeutic efficacy in a rat kidney transplant model of prolonged cold ischemia. The in vitro immunomodulatory capacity of bone marrow-derived rat MSCs was tested in co-cultures with rat lymph node cells. For in vivo studies, Dark Agouti rat kidneys were cold preserved and transplanted into Lewis rats. Syngeneic Lewis MSCs were administered intravenously. Transplants were harvested on day 3, and inflammation was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and histology. Similarly to MSCs from other species, rat MSCs in vitro also showed a dose-dependent immunomodulatory capacity. Most importantly, in vivo administration of MSCs reduced the intragraft gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In addition, fewer antigen-presenting cells were recruited into the renal allograft. In conclusion, rat MSCs ameliorate inflammation induced by prolonged cold ischemia in kidney transplantation.

Immunobiology of naïve and genetically modified HLA-class-I-knockdown human embryonic stem cells.	Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can serve as a universal cell source for emerging cell or tissue replacement strategies, but immune rejection of hESC derivatives remains an unsolved problem. Here, we sought to describe the mechanisms of rejection for naïve hESCs and upon HLA class I (HLA I) knockdown (hESC(KD)). hESCs were HLA I-positive but negative for HLA II and co-stimulatory molecules. Transplantation of naïve hESC into immunocompetent Balb/c mice induced substantial T helper cell 1 and 2 (Th1 and Th2) responses with rapid cell death, but hESCs survived in immunodeficient SCID-beige recipients. Histology revealed mainly macrophages and T cells, but only scattered natural killer (NK) cells. A surge of hESC-specific antibodies against hESC class I, but not class II antigens, was observed. Using HLA I RNA interference and intrabody technology, HLA I surface expression of hESC(KD) was 88%-99% reduced. T cell activation after hESC(KD) transplantation into Balb/c was significantly diminished, antibody production was substantially alleviated, the levels of graft-infiltrating immune cells were reduced and the survival of hESC(KD) was prolonged. Because of their very low expression of stimulatory NK ligands, NK-susceptibility of naïve hESCs and hESC(KD) was negligible. Thus, HLA I recognition by T cells seems to be the primary mechanism of hESC recognition, and T cells, macrophages and hESC-specific antibodies participate in hESC killing.

Predicting the outcome of renal transplantation.	"Renal transplantation has dramatically improved the survival rate of hemodialysis patients. However, with a growing proportion of marginal organs and improved immunosuppression, it is necessary to verify that the established allocation system, mostly based on human leukocyte antigen matching, still meets today's needs. The authors turn to machine-learning techniques to predict, from donor-recipient data, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the recipient 1 year after transplantation.
The patient's eGFR was predicted using donor-recipient characteristics available at the time of transplantation. Donors' data were obtained from Eurotransplant's database, while recipients' details were retrieved from Charité Campus Virchow-Klinikum's database. A total of 707 renal transplantations from cadaveric donors were included.
Two separate datasets were created, taking features with <10% missing values for one and <50% missing values for the other. Four established regressors were run on both datasets, with and without feature selection.
The authors obtained a Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and real eGFR (COR) of 0.48. The best model for the dataset was a Gaussian support vector machine with recursive feature elimination on the more inclusive dataset. All results are available at http://transplant.molgen.mpg.de/.
For now, missing values in the data must be predicted and filled in. The performance is not as high as hoped, but the dataset seems to be the main cause.
Predicting the outcome is possible with the dataset at hand (COR=0.48). Valuable features include age and creatinine levels of the donor, as well as sex and weight of the recipient."

BK virus-specific immunity kinetics: a predictor of recovery from polyomavirus BK-associated nephropathy.	Impaired BKV-specific immunity is associated with development of BKV-associated nephropathy. Suitable immunological parameters to identify patients at risk, however, are still debated. We monitored 18 kidney-transplant recipients through the course of self-limited BKV-reactivation (n = 11) and BKV-associated nephropathy (n = 7). BKV-specific cellular immunity directed to nonstructural small and Large T-antigen, and structural VP1-3 was analyzed in an interferon-γ Elispot assay. BKV-specific IgM and IgG were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay simultaneously. BKV-specific cellular immunity directed to five BKV-proteins increased significantly from diagnosis to resolution of BKV-reactivation (p < 0.001). Patients with self-limited BKV-reactivation developed BKV-specific T cells without therapeutic interventions, and cleared BKV-reactivation within a median period of 1 month. Patients with BKV-associated nephropathy, however, showed BKV-specific T cells after a median period of 5 months after therapeutic interventions only, and cleared BKV-reactivation after a median period of 8 months. Anti-structural T cells were detected earlier than anti-nonstructural T cells, which coincided with BKV-clearance. Patients with BKV-associated nephropathy showed the highest frequencies of BKV-specific T cells at recovery, the highest increase in BKV-specific IgG and persistence of increased IgM levels (p < 0.05). Our results suggest prognostic values of BKV-specific immune monitoring to identify those patients at risk of BKV-associated nephropathy and to aid in the management of therapeutic interventions.

Cutting Edge: Immunological consequences and trafficking of human regulatory macrophages administered to renal transplant recipients.	Regulatory macrophages (M regs) were administered to two living-donor renal transplant recipients. Both patients were minimized to low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy within 24 wk of transplantation and subsequently maintained excellent graft function. After central venous administration, most M regs remained viable and were seen to traffic from the pulmonary vasculature via the blood to liver, spleen, and bone marrow. By 1 y posttransplantation, both patients displayed patterns of peripheral blood gene expression converging upon the IOT-RISET signature. Furthermore, both patients maintained levels of peripheral blood FOXP3 and TOAG-1 mRNA expression within the range consistent with nonrejection. It is concluded that M regs warrant further study as a potential immune-conditioning therapy for use in solid-organ transplantation. The results of this work are being used to inform the design of The ONE Study, a multinational clinical trial of immunomodulatory cell therapy in renal transplantation.

Inflammatory phase of bone healing initiates the regenerative healing cascade.	Bone healing commences with an inflammatory reaction which initiates the regenerative healing process leading in the end to reconstitution of bone. An unbalanced immune reaction during this early bone healing phase is hypothesized to disturb the healing cascade in a way that delays bone healing and jeopardizes the successful healing outcome. The immune cell composition and expression pattern of angiogenic factors were investigated in a sheep bone osteotomy model and compared to a mechanically-induced impaired/delayed bone healing group. In the impaired/delayed healing group, significantly higher T cell percentages were present in the bone hematoma and the bone marrow adjacent to the osteotomy gap when compared to the normal healing group. This was mirrored in the higher cytotoxic T cell percentage detected under delayed bone healing conditions indicating longer pro-inflammatory processes. The highly activated periosteum adjourning the osteotomy gap showed lower expression of hematopoietic stem cell markers and angiogenic factors such as heme oxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor. This indicates a deferred revascularization of the injured area due to ongoing pro-inflammatory processes in the delayed healing group. Results from this study suggest that there are unfavorable immune cells and factors participating in the initial healing phase. In conclusion, identifying beneficial aspects may lead to promising therapeutical approaches that might benefit further by eliminating the unfavorable factors.

Systemic changes of tryptophan catabolites via the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase pathway in primary cervical cancer.	"Induction of tryptophan catabolism is mediated by inflammatory mechanisms including up-regulation of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). This leads to the formation of mediators collectively referred to as kynurenines. Kynurenines are involved in various diseases such as renal failure, sepsis and cancer. We aimed to investigate whether systemic levels of kynurenines are induced in primary cervical cancer (PCC).
Tryptophan, serotonin, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid and estimated IDO activity were determined using tandem mass spectrometry for serum samples of 20 PCC patients (mean age: 45.1±11.3 years, FIGO-stage: 1b1-2b) prior to radical abdominal surgery. Data were compared to those from 40 healthy controls. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were performed.
Mean tryptophan (22.7±15.1 vs. 18.9±3.5 μM; p=0.27) and kynurenine levels (2.25±0.7 vs. 2.59±0.25 μM; p=0.1) were unchanged in PCC patients when compared to controls. Estimated IDO activity (kynurenine level × 100/tryptophan: 11.8±4.5 vs. 14.1±2.4; p=0.04) and mean levels of kynurenic acid (0.25±0.06 vs. 0.55±0.23 μM; p<0.0001) were significantly lower in PCC patients compared to controls, while mean levels of quinolinic acid (0.35±0.07 vs. 0.24±0.09 μM, p<0.0001) were significantly higher. The ratio of quinolinic acid to kynurenic acid (Q/K) differed significantly between patients with and those without cancer (p<0.0001). When this index was >0.95, the sensitivity and specificity for identification of PCC patients were 100% and 90%, respectively (AUC=0.981, 95% CI=0.907-0.999; positive likelihood ratio +10.0).
PCC is associated with increased systemic levels of quinolinic acid and reduced levels of kynurenic acid. In our study population, the Q/K allowed identification of PCC patients with a high level of accuracy. The prognostic power and relevance of this novel proposed index remains to be elucidated in further larger prospective studies."

Haem oxygenase-1 dictates intrauterine fetal survival in mice via carbon monoxide.	Pregnancy establishment implies the existence of a highly vascularized and transient organ, the placenta, which ensures oxygen supply to the fetus via haemoproteins. Haem metabolism, including its catabolism by haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), should be of importance in maintaining the homeostasis of haemoproteins and controlling the deleterious effects associated with haem release from maternal or fetal haemoglobins, thus ensuring placental function and fetal development. We demonstrate that HO-1 expression is essential to promote placental function and fetal development, thus determining the success of pregnancy. Hmox1 deletion in mice has pathological consequences for pregnancy, namely suboptimal placentation followed by intrauterine fetal growth restriction (IUGR) and fetal lethality. These pathological effects can be mimicked by administration of exogenous haem in wild-type mice. Fetal and maternal HO-1 is required to prevent post-implantation fetal loss through a mechanism that acts independently of maternal adaptive immunity and hormones. The protective HO-1 effects on placentation and fetal growth can be mimicked by the exogenous administration of carbon monoxide (CO), a product of haem catabolism by HO-1 that restores placentation and fetal growth. In a clinical relevant model of IUGR, CO reduces the levels of free haem in circulation and prevents fetal death. We unravel a novel physiological role for HO-1/CO in sustaining pregnancy which aids in understanding the biology of pregnancy and reveals a promising therapeutic application in the treatment of pregnancy pathologies.

Plasmacytoma-like post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, a rare subtype of monomorphic B-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferation, is associated with a favorable outcome in localized as well as in advanced disease: a prospective analysis of 8 cases.	Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) with plasmacellular differentiation has been reported as a rare subtype of monomorphic B-cell post-transplant lympho-proliferation with histological and immunophenotypical features of plasmacytoma in the non-transplant population. Here we present clinical, laboratory and histopathological features, treatment and outcome of 8 patients from the German prospective PTLD registry. Clinically, extranodal manifestations were common while osteolytic lesions were rare and none of the patients had bone marrow involvement. Immunohistochemistry showed light chain restriction and expression of CD138 without CD20 expression in all samples. An association with Epstein-Barr virus was found in 3 out of 8 cases. We suggest that the Ann Arbor classification is most useful for this disease entity and report a generally good response to treatment including reduction of immuno-suppression, surgery and irradiation in localized disease and systemic chemotherapy analogous to plasmacell myeloma in advanced disease.

Monitoring tolerance and rejection in organ transplant recipients.	To avoid toxic side effects caused by permanent immunosuppressive treatment, research in transplantation focuses on new treatment strategies inducing tolerance or allowing drug weaning. Implementing drug minimization into clinical routine can be only safely achieved when guided by biomarkers reflecting the individual immune reactivity. We review recently described biomarkers and assays allowing identification of patients suitable for drug weaning or at risk of rejection. However, the majority of described biomarkers and assays have not been validated in prospective clinical trials. Thus, collaborative efforts are needed to design and perform prospective multicenter trials to validate the identified biomarkers across different laboratories.

Reduction of gastrointestinal complications in renal graft recipients after conversion from mycophenolate mofetil to enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium.	Gastrointestinal (GI) complications such as diarrhea or indigestion frequently occur in renal graft recipients treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), requiring dose reductions to reduce side effects, thereby increasing the risk of rejection episodes and graft loss. In a prospective clinical trial, the immunosuppressive therapy of renal graft recipients was converted from MMF to enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) to identify a strategy to reduce GI symptoms without dose reduction. At baseline and 6-8 weeks later patients filled in 4 questionnaires related to GI symptoms and general and health-related quality of life. In 15 German study centers, 196 renal graft recipients (mean age 49.5 ± 13.5 years; male/female, 120/76) were included; 51.0% of patients suffered from GI complications at baseline. The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale score decreased significantly (P < .001) in patients with GI complications from 2.61 ± 0.86 at baseline to 2.14 ± 0.86 at visit 2. Health-related and general quality of life improved significantly. Fifty percent of patients with GI symptoms and 34% of the total per protocol population reported an improvement of their physical condition after converting the medication. In conclusion, conversion from MMF to EC-MPS reduces GI complications in renal graft recipients, reduces the patients' physical discomfort, and maintains their quality of life.

IL-6 and IL-10 in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders development and maintenance: a longitudinal study of cytokine plasma levels and T-cell subsets in 38 patients undergoing treatment.	IL-6 and IL-10 have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) and, like peripheral lymphocyte populations, are markers of immune status that are amenable to study in vivo. Thus, we analyzed cytokine plasma levels as well as lymphocyte subsets in a longitudinal analysis of 38 adult transplant recipients undergoing treatment for PTLD. Pretherapeutically, we found significantly elevated IL-6 (13.8 pg/ml) and IL-10 plasma levels (54.7 pg/ml) - in the case of IL-10, even higher in treatment nonresponders than in responders (116 vs. 14 pg/ml). Over time, however, IL-10 levels did not correlate with the course of disease, whereas those of IL-6 did, falling in responders and rising in nonresponders. These findings were independent of histological EBV-status, treatment type, and total peripheral T-cell counts, which were significantly reduced in patients with PTLD. Our observations support the idea that although IL-10 is important for creating a permissive environment for post-transplant lymphoma development, IL-6 is associated with PTLD proliferation. The analysis of lymphocyte subsets further identified HLA-DR+ CD8+ lymphocyte numbers as significantly different in non-PTLD controls (33%), treatment responders (44%) and nonresponders (70%). Although the specificity of these cells is unclear, their increase might correlate with the impaired tumor-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL)-response in PTLD.

BK polyomavirus infection and nephropathy: the virus-immune system interplay.	Reactivation of latent BK polyomavirus (BKV) infection continues to be a major challenge in renal graft recipients. Progression of BKV infection to BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) leads to graft loss in up to 60% of affected patients. Interestingly, although >80% of healthy adults are seropositive for BKV, BKVAN occurs almost exclusively in transplanted kidneys, which raises questions about its underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Intragraft inflammation and an insufficient antiviral immune response seem to be the most important risk factors. Early studies revealed an association between the rate of recovery of BKV-specific cellular immunity (which shows high interindividual variation) and BK viral clearance, which determines the clinical course of BKV infection. In patients with prompt recovery of BKV-specific T cells, BKV infection can be controlled at the early reactivation stage and does not progress to BKVAN. By contrast, in patients with persistent BKV reactivation caused by insufficient BKV-specific immunity, continued viral replication and inflammation ultimately lead to graft injury and/or BKVAN. As the chronic course of BKV infection can be prevented in most patients by prompt restoration of BKV-specific immunity, frequent monitoring of BK viral load and targeted, timely modification or reduction of immunosuppression is strongly recommended for affected patients.

Differential expression and function of α-mannosidase I in stimulated naive and memory CD4+ T cells.	N-linked protein glycosylation represents an important cellular process for modifying protein properties. It resembles a cascade of various enzymatic reactions, in which class I α-mannosidases play a central role. We and others have recently shown that N-glycosylation plays a major role for immune functions. We now analyzed the expression and function of α-mannosidase I in CD4(+) naive and memory T cells studying human and murine T cells. Alpha-mannosidase I function was altered by (i) treatment with Kifunensine, a specific inhibitor class I α-mannosidases, (ii) synthetic inhibitory RNA, and (iii) overexpression by retroviral gene transfer. T-cell activation was evaluated by CD69 expression, cytokine production and proliferation. Our results demonstrate (i) that α-mannosidase I transcription is transiently downregulated after T-cell activation with either polyclonal anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or allogeneic CD19(+) B cells, and (ii) that α-mannosidase I exerts an inhibitory effect on T-cell activation. It is interesting to note that the inhibitory effect was restricted to naive CD4(+) T cells in both systems, human T cells and murine transgenic CD4(+)OT-II cells, whereas human memory T cells and primed CD4(+)OT-II cells remained unaffected. Alpha-mannosidase I inhibition reduced the activation threshold for naive but not already primed CD4(+)OT-II cells as the cells were able to respond to lower ovalbumin peptide concentrations and increased the rejection potential of alloreactive T cells in vivo. Thus, complex N-glycans generated by enzymes such as α-mannosidase I inhibit the activation of naive T cells. These findings could be used to improve the ex vivo priming of naive T cells for adaptive T-cell therapies.

Adiponectin is a negative regulator of antigen-activated T cells.	Adiponectin (APN), a cytokine constitutively produced in fat tissue, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in various disease models. While the influence of APN on monocytic cells has been extensively studied in vitro, little is known about its role in T cells. In this study, we show that while <10% of human peripheral blood T cells express adiponectin receptors (AdipoRs) on their surface, most T cells store AdipoRs in intracellular compartments. AdipoRs colocalized with immune regulatory molecules CTLA-4 and TIRC7 within clathrin-coated vesicles. After stimulation, the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2 was upregulated on the surface of antigen-specific T cells, as determined by tetramer or CD137 staining, and AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 coexpressed with CTLA-4. Addition of APN resulted in a significant diminution of antigen-specific T-cell expansion. Mechanistically, APN enhanced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of antigen-specific T-cell lines. Further, APN directly inhibited cytokine production in response to antigen stimulation. In line with the in vitro data, APN-deficient (knockout, KO) mice had higher frequencies of CD137(+) T cells upon Coxsackie B virus infection. Altogether, our data suggest that APN is a novel negative T-cell regulator. In contrast to the CTLA-4 ligand B7 only expressed on APCs, APN is abundant in human plasma.

BK-VP3 as a new target of cellular immunity in BK virus infection.	"Polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) infection represents a serious complication leading to BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) and subsequent kidney graft loss in up to 10% of transplant patients. Cellular immunity is known to play a crucial role in the control of BKV replication. However, the knowledge on the BKV-T-cell response is limited: only two (VP1 and large T antigen) of six known BKV proteins were evaluated for their antigenicity so far.
By using 10-color flow cytometry and newly created overlapping peptide pools of five BKV antigens (VP1, VP2, VP3, large T antigen, and small t antigen), we performed cross-sectional phenotypic and functional analysis of BKV-specific T cells in kidney transplant patients with a history of BKVAN. Patients with clinically unapparent BKV infection (history of transient/no BKV reactivation) were used as control group.
Our data demonstrate for the first time the antigenic properties of all five evaluated proteins with VP3 as a new important target of cellular immunity. Further, we found a correlation between the severity of the previous BKV infection and the magnitude of memory CD4+ T-cell response. Thus, compared with the control group, patients with a history of BKVAN demonstrated significantly higher frequencies of interferon-γ- and interleukin-2-producing effector memory CD4+ T cells. In the control group, more patients with detectable interferon-γ+/interleukin-2+/tumor necrosis factor+ triple producers were found, suggesting possibly a protective function of these multifunctional T cells.
In conclusion, our study results suggest an implementation of new targets for monitoring of BKV immunity. Further studies are required to evaluate the protective function of the found BKV-specific T-cell subsets."

Control of TNF-induced dendritic cell maturation by hybrid-type N-glycans.	The activity of α-1,2-mannosidase I is required for the conversion of high-mannose to hybrid-type (ConA reactive) and complex-type N-glycans (Phaseolus vulgaris-leukoagglutinin [PHA-L] reactive) during posttranslational protein N-glycosylation. We recently demonstrated that α-1,2-mannosidase I mRNA decreases in graft-infiltrating CD11c(+) dendritic cells (DCs) prior to allograft rejection. Although highly expressed in immature DCs, little is known about its role in DC functions. In this study, analysis of surface complex-type N-glycan expression by lectin staining revealed the existence of PHA-L(low) and PHA-L(high) subpopulations in murine splenic conventional DCs, as well as in bone marrow-derived DC (BMDCs), whereas plasmacytoid DCs are nearly exclusively PHA-L(high). Interestingly, all PHA-L(high) DCs displayed a strongly reduced responsiveness to TNF-α-induced p38-MAPK activation compared with PHA-L(low) DCs, indicating differences in PHA-L-binding capacities between DCs with different inflammatory properties. However, p38 phosphorylation levels were increased in BMDCs overexpressing α-1,2-mannosidase I mRNA. Moreover, hybrid-type, but not complex-type, N-glycans are required for TNF-α-induced p38-MAPK activation and subsequent phenotypic maturation of BMDCs (MHC-II, CD86, CCR7 upregulation). α-1,2-mannosidase I inhibitor-treated DCs displayed diminished transendothelial migration in response to CCL19, homing to regional lymph nodes, and priming of IFN-γ-producing T cells in vivo. In contrast, the activity of α-1,2-mannosidase I is dispensable for LPS-induced signaling, as well as the DCs' general capability for phenotypic and functional maturation. Systemic application of an α-1,2-mannosidase I inhibitor was able to significantly prolong allograft survival in a murine high-responder corneal transplantation model, further highlighting the importance of N-glycan processing by α-1,2-mannosidase I for alloantigen presentation and T cell priming.

Expression of functional T-cell markers and T-cell receptor Vbeta repertoire in endomyocardial biopsies from patients presenting with acute myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy.	"To quantify and functionally characterize the intramyocardial T-cells in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from patients presenting with acute myocarditis (AMC) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
Expression of genes characterizing Th1 [interferon (IFN)γ, Tbet-1, Eomesodermin, interleukin (IL)-27], Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, GATA3), Th17 (IL-17), regulatory [regulatory T-cells (Treg); FoxP3, TGFβ, IL-10], anergic (GRAIL), and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs: Perforin, Granulysin, Granzyme A), as well as of functional T-cell receptor Vbeta (TRBV) families were investigated in EMBs from AMC patients (n= 58) and DCM patients (n= 34) by pre-amplified real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These data were compared with EMBs from n= 19 controls. Expression of CD3d, CD3z, and TRBC (T-cell receptor beta constant region) were associated with the immunohistological diagnosis of inflammatory cardiomyopathy (DCMi). In EMBs from DCM patients with increased CD3d expression, significantly increased markers of Th1 (IFNγ, T-bet, Eomesodermin), regulatory T-cells (Treg; FoxP3, TGFβ), and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs: Perforin, Granulysin, Granzyme A) were present, while no differential polarization of T-cells was found in EMBs form AMC patients. A differential dominance of distinct functional TRBV families was associated with different cardiotropic viruses: TRBV 11 and 24 with Parvovirus B19; TRBV4, 10 and 28 with human herpes virus type 6; and TRBV14 for Coxsackie virus, respectively.
The T-cell infiltrates in human DCMi are characterized by differential expression of functional T-cell markers indicating Th1, Treg, and CTLs, while no major role could be confirmed for Th17. The virus-associated differential TRBV dominance suggests an antiviral specificity of virus-induced T-cell responses in human DCMi."

Persistent CMV infection correlates with disease activity and dominates the phenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells in psoriasis.	"Previously, we have reported a frequent association of active plaque psoriasis with inflammation-mediated cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation.
This study aimed at characterizing the impact of CMV infection on psoriasis disease activity and peripheral cellular adaptive immune response.
Twenty nine patients with active plaque psoriasis and 29 healthy controls were analysed for CMV-serostatus, CMV-antigenaemia, frequencies of peripheral CMV-specific T cells and the immunophenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells.
(i) Psoriasis severity was higher in CMV-seropositive patients and positively correlated to the severity of CMV-antigenaemia. (ii) In comparison to CMV-seropositive healthy controls, CMV-seropositive psoriasis patients showed a reduced frequency of circulating CMV-specific T cells that increased under effective antipsoriatic therapy. (iii) The immunophenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells was dominated by CMV-seroprevalence. (iv) Selective analysis of CMV-seronegative psoriasis patients revealed a strong expansion of a - probably early activated - CD8+ T-cell population with the yet undescribed differentiation phenotype 'CD45RA-dim/CD11a-dim'. Under effective antipsoriatic therapy this population decreased in parallel to an increase of effector differentiated CD8+ T cells.
Taken together with our previous results of inflammation-mediated CMV reactivation in psoriasis, our data support the concept of an interactive relationship between psoriasis and CMV infection which may be mediated by peripheral CD8+ T cells."

Long-term outcome of ATG vs. Basiliximab induction.	"An evaluation of the long-term efficacy and incidence of adverse events after induction therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) vs. Basiliximab in renal transplant patients.
Sixty recipients receiving ATG induction and a dual immunosuppression with Tacrolimus and steroids were compared retrospectively with 60 patients treated with Basiliximab. The following characteristics were evaluated: concomitant immunosuppression, recipient age, donor age, time on dialysis, cold ischemia time, year of transplantation and HLA mismatches.
The 6-year patient survival in the ATG group was 91·7% compared to 85% in the Basiliximab group (not significant, n.s.). Graft survival at 6 years was 89·7% and. 83·6% in the ATG and the Basiliximab group (n.s.), respectively. Incidence of biopsy proven acute rejection episodes (33·3% vs. 26·7%) and delayed graft function (30% vs. 33·3%) were similar in both groups. Kidney function was not significantly different at 1 and 6 years. CMV infections were more prevalent in the ATG arm (22% vs. 5%; P = 0·05), and a significantly higher rate of haematological complications was observed following ATG induction.
ATG induction was associated with an improved (but n.s.) trend in patient and graft survival. Patients induced with ATG had a higher rate of CMV infections and haematological complications."

Characterization of immunostimulatory components of orf virus (parapoxvirus ovis).	Inactivated orf virus (ORFV, parapoxvirus ovis) induces antiviral activity in animal models of acute and chronic viral infections and exerts strong effects on human immune cells. ORFV activates antigen presenting cells (APC) via CD14 and, probably, Toll-like receptor signalling, and triggers the release of IFN-γ that has been identified as the key mediator of the antiviral activity. After delineating virus proteins as being the most likely active constituent, we aimed to characterize the ORFV proteins responsible for the therapeutic effect. By using a vaccinia virus/ORFV expression library we identified several multi-gene DNA fragments with strong immunomodulatory activity. Together these fragments contain 27 ORFs. The encoded proteins are related to virion structure and transcription but are otherwise unrelated. Two proteins were separately expressed and purified, and demonstrated immunostimulatory activity. Gene expression profiles induced by ORFV and the identified fragments were investigated by microarray analysis. Interestingly, all active fragments induced a similar gene-expression pattern, differing only in quantitative aspects. Obviously, several proteins of ORFV activate similar cellular pathways, modulating APC to generate a strong T-helper 1-dominated immune response. This was balanced by additional induction of immune dampening mechanisms, suggesting regulatory differences compared to single cytokine therapies. We conclude that ORFV may have the potential to enrich the armamentarium of antiviral therapies.

Everolimus-based, calcineurin-inhibitor-free regimen in recipients of de-novo kidney transplants: an open-label, randomised, controlled trial.	"Non-nephrotoxic immunosuppressive strategies that allow reduction of calcineurin-inhibitor exposure without compromising safety or efficacy remain a goal in kidney transplantation. Immunosuppression based on the mammalian-target-of-rapamycin inhibitor everolimus was assessed as a strategy for elimination of calcineurin-inhibitor exposure and optimisation of renal-graft function while maintaining efficacy.
In the ZEUS multicentre, open-label study, 503 patients (aged 18-65 years) who had received de-novo kidney transplants were enrolled. After initial treatment with ciclosporin, based on trough concentrations, and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (1440 mg/day, orally), corticosteroids (≥5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent, orally), and basiliximab induction (20 mg, intravenously, on day 0 [2 h before transplantation], and on day 4), 300 (60%) patients were randomly assigned at 4·5 months in a 1:1 ratio to undergo calcineurin-inhibitor elimination (everolimus-based regimen that was based on trough concentrations [6-10 ng/mL] and enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium [1440 mg/day] with corticosteroids), or continue standard ciclosporin-based treatment. Randomisation was done by use of a central, validated system that automated the random assignment of treatment groups to randomisation numbers. The primary objective was to show better renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR]; Nankivell formula) with the calcineurin-inhibitor-free everolimus regimen at 12 months after transplantation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00154310.
118 (76%) of 155 everolimus-treated patients and 117 (81%) of 145 ciclosporin-treated patients completed treatment with study drug up to 12 months after transplantation. At this timepoint, the everolimus regimen was associated with a significant improvement in GFR versus the ciclosporin regimen (71·8 mL/min per 1·73 m(2) vs 61·9 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), respectively; mean difference 9·8 mL/min per 1·73 m(2), 95% CI -12·2 to -7·5). Rates of biopsy-proven acute rejection were higher in the everolimus group than in the ciclosporin group after randomisation (15 [10%] of 154 vs five [3%] of 146; p = 0·036), but similar for the full study period (23 [15%] vs 22 [15%]). Compared with the ciclosporin regimen, higher mean lipid concentrations, slightly increased urinary protein excretion, and lower haemoglobin concentrations were noted with the everolimus regimen; thrombocytopenia, aphthous stomatitis, and diarrhoea also occurred more often in the everolimus group. A higher incidence of hyperuricaemia was noted with ciclosporin.
Early elimination of calcineurin inhibitor by use of everolimus-based immunosuppression improved renal function at 12 months while maintaining efficacy and safety, indicating that this strategy may facilitate improved long-term outcomes in selected patients.

Efficient tetanus toxoid immunization on vitamin D supplementation.	"Vitamin D mediates immunomodulatory functions, and its deficiency has been associated with an increased prevalence of immunological diseases. The supplementation of vitamin D might be therapeutically beneficial, for example, in lupus erythematosus patients. However, its affect on established recall immune responses is undefined.
In all, 32 individuals were randomized in a placebo controlled, double-blind setting, and received vitamin D (daily 2000 IU) for 10 weeks followed by tetanus toxoid (TT) booster immunization.
During vitamin D supplementation the median 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum concentration increased to 80.3 nM, which as expected decreased in the placebo group to 29.1 nM during the ultraviolet-deprived winter months. The TT-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) boost efficiency was marginal higher in the vitamin D group (P = 0.04). The increase of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels correlated with the increase of TT-IgG serum concentrations. The induction of specific serum IgA and specific antibody secreting cells was comparable between both groups. Accordingly, the TT-specific and polyclonally triggered T-cell cytokine profiles were stable as well.

Studies on bacterial endotoxin and intestinal absorption function in patients with chronic heart failure.	"Small intestinal function may be altered in decompensated chronic heart failure (CHF) and translocating LPS may contribute to systemic inflammation observed in CHF.
We measured intestinal permeability (melibiose and rhamnose), active (3-O-methyl-d-glucose (3-OMG)) and passive (d-xylose) carrier-mediated absorption in 20 CHF patients (12 edematous and 8 non-edematous) and 8 controls by saccharide absorption technique assessing urinary recovery of orally administered sugars. We additionally measured LPS concentrations in 42 patients with decompensated heart failure and after recompensation.
CHF patients had a 54% reduction of active carrier-mediated intestinal transport compared to controls (p<0.0001). This reduction was strongest in edematous compared to non-edematous patients and controls (recovery in urine: 13.2±2.0% vs. 20.8±2.4% vs. 36.0 ± 3.7%, all p ≤ 0.05). Patients showed a 34% reduction of passive carrier-mediated transport, strongest in edematous patients (p=0.006). A greater impairment of active carrier-mediated transport remained significant after adjustment for non-mucosal factors in CHF (p=0.0004). Non carrier-mediated intestinal permeability was not altered. Data from 42 decompensated patients showed a decrease in LPS after recompensation (p=0.004). Edematous patients had highest blood concentrations of LPS, TNF and sTNF-R1 (p<0.04). CHF patients with abnormal LPS concentrations >0.50EU/mL (n=7) had the highest concentrations of TNF (7.0 ± 1.6 vs. 3.1 ± 0.3pg/mL, p<0.02), and sTNF-R1 (3499 ± 52 vs. 1599±219 pg/mL, p=0.02).
Active carrier-mediated intestinal transport is reduced in decompensated CHF indicating epithelial dysfunction possibly as a consequence of intestinal ischemia. Higher LPS concentrations in edematous CHF relate to inflammation. LPS decreased after recompensation. This suggests a cause/effect relationship between edematous gut wall, epithelial dysfunction and translocating LPS."

Tuberculin-specific T cells are reduced in active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to LTBI or status post BCG vaccination.	Functional characteristics of tuberculosis (TB)-specific CD4 T cells were studied in clinically active pulmonary TB (n = 21) and high TB exposure including LTBI (n = 17). Following tuberculin stimulation, activated CD4 T cells were identified by flow-cytometry (CD154 up-regulation, degranulation, interferon γ [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], and interleukin 2 [IL-2\ production). Interestingly, CD154 up-regulation accounted for ∼80% of activated CD4 T cells in the active TB group but just 40% in the controls, whereas IFN-γ accounted for only ∼50% of activated cells in each group. The frequencies of CD4 T cells displaying at least 1 activation marker discriminated better between the groups than those displaying degranulation or IFN-γ production alone.

Immunoparalysis and nosocomial infection in children with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.	"Immunoparalysis defined by prolonged monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR depression is associated with adverse outcomes in adult severe sepsis and can be reversed with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We hypothesized that immunoparalysis defined by whole-blood ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) response <200 pg/mL beyond day 3 of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is similarly associated with nosocomial infection in children and can be reversed with GM-CSF.
In study period 1, we performed a multicenter cohort trial of transplant and nontransplant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) patients (≥2 organ failure). In study period 2, we performed an open-label randomized trial of GM-CSF therapy for nonneutropenic, nontransplant, severe MODS patients (≥3 organ failure) with TNFα response <160 pg/mL.
Immunoparalysis was observed in 34% of MODS patients (n = 70) and was associated with increased nosocomial infection (relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [1.8-6.0] p < 0.05) and mortality (RR 5.8 [2.1-16] p < 0.05). TNFα response <200 pg/mL throughout 7 days after positive culture was associated with persistent nosocomial infection, whereas recovery above 200 pg/mL was associated with resolution of infection (p < 0.05). In study period 2, GM-CSF therapy facilitated rapid recovery of TNFα response to >200 pg/mL by 7 days (p < 0.05) and prevented nosocomial infection (no infections in seven patients versus eight infections in seven patients) (p < 0.05).
Similar to in adults, immunoparalysis is a potentially reversible risk factor for development of nosocomial infection in pediatric MODS.

Deficiency of IL-22 contributes to a chronic inflammatory disease: pathogenetic mechanisms in acne inversa.	Overexpression of the T cell cytokine IL-22 is linked to the development of some chronic diseases, but little is known about IL-22 deficiency in humans. As demonstrated in this study, acne inversa (AI; also designated as Hidradenitis suppurativa) lesions show a relative deficiency of IL-22 and IL-20, but not of IL-17A, IL-26, IFN-γ, IL-24, or IL-1β. Moreover, AI lesions had reduced expression of membranous IL-22 and IL-20 receptors and increased expression of the natural IL-22 inhibitor, IL-22 binding protein. AI is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with prevalence up to 4% of the population and in which cutaneous bacterial persistence represents an important pathogenetic factor. Accordingly, we also found a relative deficiency of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs) in AI lesions and a positive correlation between lesional IL-22 and IL-20 versus AMP levels. IL-22, like its tissue cell downstream mediator IL-20, upregulated AMPs in reconstituted human epidermis and was critical for increased AMP levels under inflammatory conditions. The relative IL-22 deficiency in AI was not linked to lesional T cell numbers or Th22/Th1/Th17 subset markers and -inducing cytokines. However, IL-10 was highly expressed in AI lesions and correlated negatively with IL-22 expression. Moreover, IL-10 inhibited IL-22 but not IL-17 production in vitro. The IL-10 overexpression, in turn, was not associated with an elevated presence of regulatory T cells but with the enhanced presence of an IL-10-inducing cytokine. We conclude that IL-22 deficiency may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain chronic disorders as postulated in this paper for AI.

Absolute and functional iron deficiency in professional athletes during training and recovery.	"Iron deficiency (ID) is one of the most important metabolic dysfunctions. Athletic performance depends on oxygen transport and mitochondrial efficiency, thus on optimal iron balance. We hypothesised that physical extremes result in ID in elite athletes and that the short recovery period may be insufficient to allow a lasting replenishment of iron reserves.
Iron metabolism was examined in 20 elite rowing athletes and 10 professional soccer players at the end of a competitive season, after recuperation and during pre-season training. Absolute ID values were defined as ferritin <30 μg/L, functional ID as ferritin 30-99 μg/L or 100-299 μg/L+transferrin saturation <20%.
At the end of season, 27% of all athletes had absolute ID and 70% showed functional ID. Absolute iron depletion was not generally restored after recuperation and observed at all time points in 14% of the athletes. Although athletes with initially low ferritin levels showed a slight increase during recuperation (p<0.09), these increases remained within borderline levels. Furthermore, 10% showed borderline haemoglobin levels, suggestive of mild anaemia, as defined by the World Health Organisation.
A significant proportion of professional athletes have ID, independent of the training mode. Although recuperation seems to allow a certain recovery of iron storage, particularly in athletes with initially low ferritin levels, this retrieval was insufficient to fully normalise reduced iron levels. Therefore, iron status should be carefully monitored during the various training and competitive periods in elite athletes. An adequate iron supplementation may be needed to maintain balanced iron stores."

Immune responses after acute ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction.	"We recently demonstrated an immediate immunodepressive state after acute ischemic stroke in humans.
In the present study, we prospectively analyzed immune responses in patients with middle cerebral artery stroke (n=20), acute myocardial infarction (n=20) and healthy controls (n=20, also matched for age and gender).
Compared to controls, a rapid depression of monocytic HLA-DR expression and a defective lymphocytic IFN-γ production was obvious after ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction, while total counts of leukocytes and monocytes were significantly higher after myocardial infarction. A T cell-mediated lymphopenia was accentuated in patients with severe stroke, obviously predisposing these patients for nosocomial infections.

Analysis of the peripheral T-cell repertoire in kidney transplant patients.	"The long-term stability of renal grafts depends on the absence of chronic rejection. As T cells play a key role in rejection processes, analyzing the T-cell repertoire may be useful for understanding graft function outcomes. We have therefore investigated the power of a new statistical tool, used to analyze the peripheral blood TCR repertoire, for determining immunological differences in a group of 229 stable renal transplant patients undergoing immunosuppression. Despite selecting the patients according to stringent criteria, the patients displayed heterogeneous T-cell repertoire usage, ranging from unbiased to highly selected TCR repertoires; a skewed TCR repertoire correlating with an increase in the CD8(+) /CD4(+) T-cell ratio. T-cell repertoire patterns were compared in patients with clinically opposing outcomes i.e. stable drug-free operationally tolerant recipients and patients with the ""suspicious"" form of humoral chronic rejection and were found significantly different, from polyclonal to highly selected TCR repertoires, respectively. Moreover, a selected TCR repertoire was found to positively correlate with the Banff score grade. Collectively, these data suggest that TCR repertoire categorization might be included in the calculation of a composite score for the follow-up of patients after kidney transplantation."

Immunogenicity and immunomodulatory properties of umbilical cord lining mesenchymal stem cells.	We here present an immunologic head-to-head comparison between human umbilical cord lining mesenchymal stem cells (clMSCs) and adult bone marrow MSCs (bmMSCs) from patients >65 years of age. clMSCs had significantly lower HLA class I expression, higher production of tolerogenic TGF-β and IL-10, and showed significantly faster proliferation. In vitro activation of allogeneic lymphocytes and xenogeneic in vivo immune activation was significantly stronger with bmMSCs, whereas immune recognition of clMSCs was significantly weaker. Thus, bmMSCs were more quickly rejected in immunocompetent mice. IFN-γ at 25 ng/ml increased both immunogenicity by upregulation of HLA class I/ HLA-DR expression and tolerogenicity by increasing intracellular HLA-G and surface HLA-E expression, augmenting TGF-β and IL-10 release, and inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression. Higher concentrations of IFN-γ (>50 ng/ml) further enhanced the immunosuppressive phenotype of clMSCs, more strongly downregulating HLA-DR expression and further increasing IDO production (at 500 ng/ml). The net functional immunosuppressive efficacy of MSCs was tested in mixed lymphocyte cultures. Although both clMSCs and bmMSCs significantly reduced in vitro immune activation, clMSCs were significantly more effective than bmMSCs. The veto function of both MSC lines was enhanced in escalating IFN-γ environments. In conclusion, clMSCs show a more beneficial immunogeneic profile and stronger overall immunosuppressive potential than aged bmMSCs.

State of the art on the research for biomarkers allowing individual, tailor-made minimization of immunosuppression.	"In order to avoid toxic side effects by long-term immunosuppressive treatment, transplant research therefore focuses on new strategies to either induce tolerance or allow partial or complete immunosuppressive weaning whenever possible. This can be only safely achieved when guided by biomarkers reflecting the individual immune reactivity. Here we summarize the recent efforts to identify biomarkers and functional assays which allow an individualized minimization or complete weaning of immunosuppression in stable or 'operational' tolerant transplant patients, respectively.
Data obtained by two main collaborative networks, 'RISET' and 'Immune Tolerance Network' have provided a better characterization of operational tolerant kidney patients. In both studies an increased numbers of B cells and a B-cell-associated peripheral gene signature were discovered. Long-term observation of tolerant liver transplant patients undergoing immunosuppressive minimization highlight the importance of surveillance or protocol biopsies. Additionally, functional assays such as IFN-γ ELISPOT or urine markers have been shown to predict long-term graft outcome.
With the recent findings we have gained a better understanding of operational tolerant patients and have identified biomarkers and assays which will be very helpful when guiding partial or complete immunosuppressive minimization. For the future, collaborative efforts are needed to design and perform prospective multicenter trials to validate the identified biomarkers across different laboratories and laboratory platforms."

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-β1, and interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms: implication in protection or susceptibility to dengue hemorrhagic fever.	Dengue virus infection has emerged as one of the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases. Some dengue infected individuals develop the severe, life-threatening form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Host genetic factors may be relevant and may predispose some individuals to the severe illness. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA), FcγR, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), among others genes have been associated with the pathogenesis of dengue. Little is known, however, about the predictive value of cytokine genotypes for the clinical outcome of dengue infection. In this study, the TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were studied by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primer in a group of individuals with the antecedent of DHF during a secondary infection in the sequence dengue 1/dengue 2. A control group was also included. TNF-α (-308) A allele and IL-10 (-1082/-819/-592) ACC/ATA haplotype were significantly associated with DHF. TNF-α (-308) GG and TGF-β1 (c25) GG genotypes were associated with protection. Our results suggest that genetic predisposition to a high TNF-α production and a low IL-10 production seems to increase the susceptibility to DHF during a secondary dengue 2 infection, whereas TGF-β1 high producers might be protected for developing DHF.

High-mobility group box-1 protein serum levels do not reflect monocytic function in patients with sepsis-induced immunosuppression.	"High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) protein is released during ""late sepsis"" by activated monocytes. We investigated whether systemic HMGB-1 levels are associated with indices of monocytic activation/function in patients with sepsis-induced immunosuppression.
36 patients (31 male, 64 +/- 14 years) with severe sepsis/septic shock and monocytic deactivation (reduced mHLA-DR expression and TNF-alpha release) were assessed in a subanalysis of a placebo-controlled immunostimulatory trial using GM-CSF. HMGB-1 levels were assessed over a 9-day treatment interval. Data were compared to standardized biomarkers of monocytic immunity (mHLA-DR expression, TNF-alpha release).
HMGB-1 levels were enhanced in sepsis but did not differ between treatment and placebo groups at baseline (14.6 +/- 13.5 versus 12.5 +/- 11.5 ng/ml, P = .62). When compared to controls, HMGB-1 level increased transiently in treated patients at day 5 (27.8 +/- 21.7 versus 11.0 +/- 14.9, P = .01). Between group differences were not noted at any other point of assessment. HMGB-1 levels were not associated with markers of monocytic function or clinical disease severity.
GM-CSF treatment for sepsis-induced immunosuppression induces a moderate but only transient increase in systemic HMGB-1 levels. HMGB-1 levels should not be used for monitoring of monocytic function in immunostimulatory trials as they do not adequately portray contemporary changes in monocytic immunity."

MCP-1 and MIP-1α expression in a model resembling early immune response to dengue.	Dengue virus has become endemic in most tropical urban areas throughout the world, and DHF has appeared concomitantly with this expansion. The intensity of dengue virus replication during the early stages of infection could determine clinical outcomes; therefore, it is important to understand the impact of dengue virus infection on the earliest immune defense against microbial infection, which also strongly regulates the adaptive immune responses. This study was aimed at evaluating the expression of the CC-chemokines MIP-1α/CCL3 and MCP-1/CCL2 in peripheral blood leukocytes using an ex vivo model resembling dengue infection in vivo, in subjects with a well characterized dengue immune background, due to the exceptional Cuban epidemiological situation in dengue. The expression of IFNγ, TNFα and IL10 was also evaluated, giving insight about the role of MCP-1 and MIP-1α in the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. From individuals with different dengue immune background after dengue virus challenge, increased and different expression of the chemokines and cytokines studied was verified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thus demonstrating that the previous immunity to a dengue virus serotype has a strong influence on the early immune response after dengue re-infection.

Whole blood flow cytometric measurement of NFATc1 and IL-2 expression to analyze cyclosporine A-mediated effects in T cells.	The calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CsA) is one of the crucial immunosuppressive drugs given after organ transplantation. The small therapeutic window of CsA generates the dilemma that efficient and toxic drug doses differ only slightly. Moreover, these threshold concentrations differ considerably between individuals; therefore, functional assays are urgently needed. We explored whether the transcription factor NFATc1, a direct as well as indirect target of CsA, can be used as a potential biomarker to determine the individual immunosuppressive activity of CsA. First, in isolated human T cells we showed that flow cytometry is practicable to measure NFATc1, the most abundant NFATc isoform in activated T cells. Second, for whole blood we developed a flow cytometric assay to determine in parallel the inducible transcription factor NFATc1 and the cytokine IL-2 in stimulated T cells. We found that added CsA inhibits both the expression of NFATc1 and IL-2 in T cells of stimulated whole blood samples with IC(50) values of 200 and 150 nM, respectively. The intra- and inter-assay variability was low, and clinical practicability was good. Further experiments have to demonstrate whether the parallel cytometric measurement of NFATc1 and IL-2 in whole blood is a good predictor of individual CsA efficacy and toxicity in CsA-treated patients.

Development of a cross-platform biomarker signature to detect renal transplant tolerance in humans.	Identifying transplant recipients in whom immunological tolerance is established or is developing would allow an individually tailored approach to their posttransplantation management. In this study, we aimed to develop reliable and reproducible in vitro assays capable of detecting tolerance in renal transplant recipients. Several biomarkers and bioassays were screened on a training set that included 11 operationally tolerant renal transplant recipients, recipient groups following different immunosuppressive regimes, recipients undergoing chronic rejection, and healthy controls. Highly predictive assays were repeated on an independent test set that included 24 tolerant renal transplant recipients. Tolerant patients displayed an expansion of peripheral blood B and NK lymphocytes, fewer activated CD4+ T cells, a lack of donor-specific antibodies, donor-specific hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells, and a high ratio of forkhead box P3 to alpha-1,2-mannosidase gene expression. Microarray analysis further revealed in tolerant recipients a bias toward differential expression of B cell-related genes and their associated molecular pathways. By combining these indices of tolerance as a cross-platform biomarker signature, we were able to identify tolerant recipients in both the training set and the test set. This study provides an immunological profile of the tolerant state that, with further validation, should inform and shape drug-weaning protocols in renal transplant recipients.

Immune reconstitution and cytomegalovirus infection after allogeneic stem cell transplantation: the important impact of in vivo T cell depletion.	We analyzed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection risk factors and immune reconstitution kinetics in 89 patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The use of alemtuzumab for in vivo T cell depletion (TCD) had, besides the donor/recipient CMV serostatus, the strongest influence on the CMV infection risk in univariate and multivariate analyses. In comparison to without use of in vivo TCD, the CMV infection risk [hazard ratio (HR)] was 4.82-fold after TCD with alemtuzumab, but only 1.40-fold after TCD with antithymocyte globulin (ATG). Alemtuzumab strongly depressed CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell reconstitution, whereas ATG only delayed CD4(+) T cell reconstitution. Considering the reconstitution kinetics of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells, NK cells and the IgG concentration, only a low day +60 NK cell count (< or =161 versus >161/microl) was significantly associated with CMV infection development (HR 2.92, p = 0.034). CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 57% of patients with a CMV-seropositive donor, but in none of the patients with a CMV-seronegative donor on day +30 (p = 0.01). Our data indicate that the type of in vivo TCD (alemtuzumab or ATG) differentially influences both the CMV infection risk and CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cell reconstitution kinetics in patients after allo-SCT.

Renal function, efficacy, and safety of sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil after short-term calcineurin inhibitor-based quadruple therapy in de novo renal transplant patients: one-year analysis of a randomized multicenter trial.	"De novo sirolimus in calcineurin inhibitor-free regimens, although potentially useful to improve early renal function, are complicated by various drug-related side effects.
We report a prospective open-label, multicenter, randomized trial to evaluate early conversion from a CsA-based to a sirolimus (SRL)-based regimen 10 to 24 days after renal transplantation. Of the 196 patients, 141 patients with a low-to-moderate immunological risk were eligible to be converted to SRL or to continue CsA. All patients received antithymocyte globulin-F single-bolus induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids.
The primary endpoint, renal function determined by S-creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated by Nankivell formula at 12 months was significantly better in the SRL group (1.51+/-0.59 vs. 1.87+/-0.98 mg/dL or 64.5+/-25.2 vs. 53.4+/-18.0 mL/min/1.73 m). Patient survival, graft survival, and incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection after conversion were not statistically different. Drug discontinuations were significantly higher in the SRL group (36.2% vs. 19.7%). Significantly, more patients in the SRL group reported acne, aphtous, and temporary hyperlipidemia, whereas cytomegalovirus viremia was significantly decreased (7.3% vs. 28.2%).
Early conversion to a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen with SRL in combination with mycophenolate mofetil may be a useful strategy to improve renal function. The identification of appropriate candidates and safe management of SRL-related adverse events will be a key to avoid the high rate of dropouts, which currently limit the broad applicability of this protocol."

Immune privilege of endothelial cells differentiated from endothelial progenitor cells.	"The application of autologous endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) is a promising approach in cardiovascular regeneration, but the availability of cells in appropriate numbers is the limiting factor. Allogeneic EPC would be an alternative, and we therefore analysed the immunogenicity of EPC-derived endothelial cells (EC) to evaluate their potential usefulness.
Circulating EPC from rat were differentiated into EC and characterized phenotypically and functionally. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression in response to interferon-gamma was determined compared with rat aortic EC, and in vitro humoral and cellular allogeneic responses were analysed. To determine the in vivo effects, acellular aortic grafts were endothelialized in vitro with EPC-derived EC and transplanted in a complete allogeneic mismatch rat aortic interposition model. EPC-derived EC expressed endothelial-specific markers and low levels of MHC class I (MHC I), but no constitutive MHC class II (MHC II). When stimulated with interferon-gamma, they upregulated MHC I and moderately upregulated MHC II. They were protected against alloantibody/complement-mediated lysis and allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity. They were less potent in allogeneic stimulation of CD4 T cells than aortic EC. Seeding of EPC-derived EC into acellular grafts led to excellent endothelialization, and allogeneic aortic transplantation induced only mild inflammatory responses without signs of rejection.
EPC-derived EC are protected against allospecific cellular immune responses and humoral-mediated attacks in vitro. When transplanted in vivo as a component of vascular grafts, these cells are not rejected, which makes them useful in therapeutic applications, especially vascular reconstruction."

Excessive tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway precedes ongoing sepsis in critically ill patients.	It has recently been shown that an increased plasma level of the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine is an early indicator for the development of sepsis in major trauma patients. We examined the predictive value of kynurenine pathway activity for ongoing sepsis in patients being admitted to a surgical intensive care unit for different reasons. In addition, we asked whether an accumulation of kynurenines in patients' plasma depends on reduced renal clearance. We conducted a prospective observational study including 100 consecutive patients and monitored laboratory variables, physiological and adverse events, sepsis and outcome. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we quantified the five indoleamines tryptophan, serotonin (5-HT), kynurenine, quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid at baseline and twice a week during the intensive care unit stay. Among the patients enrolled, 50 did not develop sepsis in the intensive care unit (non-septic), 18 patients did not have sepsis at baseline but developed sepsis later on (pre-septic) and 32 patients already fulfilled the criteria of severe sepsis and septic shock at baseline (septic). In general, non-septic critically ill patients showed activation of the kynurenine pathway, but septic shock coincided with an exacerbation of kynurenine pathway activity even in the absence of renal failure. Importantly, plasma concentrations of quinolinic acid (area under the curve 0.832 [95% confidence interval 0.710 to 0.954]) and the Quin/Trp ratio (area under the curve 0.835 [95% confidence interval; 0.719 to 0.952]) showed the best discrimination between non-septic and pre-septic patients at baseline. These findings open new avenues for further investigations on the pathophysiology of sepsis.

Human peripheral blood and bone marrow Epstein-Barr virus-specific T-cell repertoire in latent infection reveals distinct memory T-cell subsets.	EBV infection leads to life-long viral persistence. Although EBV infection can result in chronic disease and malignant transformation, most carriers remain disease-free as a result of effective control by T cells. EBV-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells could be demonstrated in acute and chronic infection as well as during latency. Recent studies, however, provide evidence that assessing IFN-gamma alone is insufficient to assess the quantity and quality of a T-cell response. Using overlapping peptide pools of latent EBV nuclear antigen 1 and lytic BZLF-1 protein and multicolor flow cytometry, we demonstrate that the majority of ex vivo EBV-reactive T cells in healthy virus carriers are indeed IL-2- and/or TNF-producing memory cells, the latter being significantly more frequent in BM. After in vitro expansion, a substantial number of EBV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells retained a CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)-positive memory phenotype. Based on their cytokine profiles, six different EBV-specific T-cell subsets could be distinguished with TNF-single or TNF/IL-2-double producing cells expressing the highest CCR7 levels resembling early-differentiated memory T cells. Our study delineates the memory T-cell profile of a protective immune response and provides a basis for analyzing T-cell responses in EBV-associated diseases.

Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is a member of the innate immune system and has been shown to influence myocardial function, but its role in myocarditis is hitherto unknown. We therefore investigated whether or not TLR9 plays a role in this disease in coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis in mice. Left ventricular (LV) function, cardiac immune cell infiltration, virus mRNA, and components of the TLR9 downstream pathway were investigated in TLR9-deficient [knockout (KO)] and wild-type (WT) mice after infection with CVB3. Murine cardiac TLR9 expression was significantly increased in WT mice with acute CVB3 infection but not in WT mice with chronic myocarditis. Furthermore, in the acute phase of CVB3-induced myocarditis, CVB3-infected KO mice displayed improved LV function associated with reduced cardiac inflammation indexed by reduced amounts of immune cells compared with CVB3-infected WT mice. In contrast, in the chronic phase, LV function and inflammation were not seen to differ among the infected groups. The cardioprotective effects due to TLR9 deficiency were associated with suppression of the TLR9 downstream pathway as indexed by reduced cardiac levels of the adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)-88 and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha. In addition, TLR9 deficiency led to an activation of the antiviral cytokine interferon-beta in the heart as a result from viral infection. In conclusion, the MyD88/TNF-alpha axis due to TLR9 activation in the heart contributes the development of acute myocarditis but not of chronic myocarditis.	American journal of physiology.

Secondary heterologous dengue infection risk: Disequilibrium between immune regulation and inflammation?	Increased serum levels of cytokines released by cells of the immune response have been detected in patients suffering from dengue disease. Likewise, secondary infections by a different dengue virus serotype result in a highest risk of development of the severe dengue disease. Both findings suggest that the memory immune response is one of the key players in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here we take advantage of the particular Cuban epidemiological situation in dengue to analyze a broad spectrum of cell-mediated immune response mediators at mRNA and protein level. Evidences for a regulatory immune pattern in homologous (TGF-beta, IL-10) vs. pro-inflammatory pattern (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) in heterologous dengue virus re-challenge were found, suggesting a possible association with the higher incidence of severe dengue cases in the latter case.

Human immune responses to porcine xenogeneic matrices and their extracellular matrix constituents in vitro.	Several tissue engineering approaches for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are based on a xenogeneic extracellular matrix. However, the application of engineered heart valves has failed in some patients, causing severe signs of inflammation by so far undetermined processes. Therefore we investigated the immune-mediated responses to porcine valve matrices (native, decellularized and glutaraldehyde-fixed) and to purified xenogeneic extracellular matrix proteins (ECMp). The induction of human immune responses in vitro was evaluated by analyzing the co-stimulatory effects of matrices and ECMp collagen and elastin on the proliferation of immune cell sub-populations via CFSE-based proliferation assays. The pattern of cytokine release was also determined. In porcine matrix punches we demonstrated strong immune responses with the native as well as the decellularized type, in contrast to attenuated effects with glutaraldehyde-fixed matrices. Furthermore, our results indicate that collagen type I (porcine and human) and human elastin were able to elicit proliferation in co-stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody, accompanied by a strong release of Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha). In contrast, porcine elastin did not elicit any response at all. This low immunogenic potential of porcine elastin suggests its suitability for the creation of new tissue engineering heart valve scaffolds in the future.

Perioperative gene expression analysis for prediction of postoperative sepsis.	"Postoperative sepsis is one of the main causes of death after major abdominal surgery; however, the immunologic factors contributing to the development of sepsis are not completely understood. In this study, we evaluated gene expression in patients who developed postoperative sepsis and in patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course.
We enrolled 220 patients in a retrospective matched-pair, case-control pilot study to investigate the perioperative expression of 23 inflammation-related genes regarding their properties for predicting postoperative sepsis. Twenty patients exhibiting symptoms of sepsis in the first 14 days after surgery (case group) were matched with 20 control patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course. Matching criteria were sex, age, main diagnosis, type of surgery, and concomitant diseases. Blood samples were drawn before surgery and on the first and second postoperative days. Relative gene expression was analyzed with real-time reverse-transcription PCR.
Significant differences (P < 0.005) in gene expression between the 2 groups were observed for IL1B (interleukin 1, beta), TNF [tumor necrosis factor (TNF superfamily, member 2)], CD3D [CD3d molecule, delta (CD3-TCR complex)], and PRF1 [perforin 1 (pore forming protein)]. Logistic regression analysis and a subsequent ROC curve analysis revealed that the combination of TNF, IL1B, and CD3D expression had a specificity and specificity of 90% and 85%, respectively, and predicted exclusion of postoperative sepsis with an estimated negative predictive value of 98.1%.
These data suggest that gene expression analysis may be an effective tool for differentiating patients at high and low risk for sepsis after abdominal surgery."

The persistence of paternal antigens in the maternal body is involved in regulatory T-cell expansion and fetal-maternal tolerance in murine pregnancy.	"Mammalian pregnancy is a state of immunological tolerance and CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) contribute to its maintenance. Knowing that Treg act in an antigen-specific way during pregnancy, we hypothesized that they are generated after maternal immune cells encounter paternal antigens.
We mated wild type females with transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) males in an allogenic setting and killed them on different days of pregnancy.
Presence of paternal and maternal MHC class II(+) cells in vaginal lavage on day 0.5 of pregnancy was confirmed. Thus, antigen presentation may take place early during pregnancy in the periphery either by the direct or indirect pathways. Foxp3(+) cells known to have regulatory activity could be detected on day 2 of pregnancy in lymph nodes and shortly after implantation at the fetal-maternal interface.
Our data suggest that paternal antigens are processed early during pregnancy, which leads to the generation of Treg. The continuous release of placental antigens into the maternal circulation allows the maintenance of a Treg population which is specific for paternal antigens and mediates tolerance toward the semi-allogeneic fetus until the time point of birth."

Treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is associated with reduced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and kynurenine pathway catabolites in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.	The immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) controls tryptophan metabolism and is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli. We investigated whether immunostimulatory treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) influences IDO activity and tryptophan metabolism in sepsis. Thirty-six patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (assessed using monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression) were assessed in a controlled trial of GM-CSF or placebo treatment for 8 days. Using tandem mass spectrometry, levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and estimated IDO activity were determined in a blinded fashion over a 9-day interval. At baseline, tryptophan and metabolite levels did not differ between the study groups. Although tryptophan levels were unchanged in both groups over the treatment interval (all p>0.8), IDO activity was markedly reduced after GM-CSF treatment (35.4 +/- 21.0 vs 21.6 +/-9.9 (baseline vs day 9), p = 0.02). IDO activity differed significantly between the 2 groups after therapy (p = 0.03). Metabolites downstream of IDO (kynurenine, quinolinic acid, kynurenic acid) were all induced in sepsis and declined in the GM-CSF group, but not in controls. Serotonin pathway metabolites remained unchanged in both groups (all p>0.15). Moreover, IDO activity correlated with procalcitonin (p< 0.0001, r = 0.56) and mHLA-DR levels (p = 0.005, r = -0.28) in the overall samples group. Thus, GM-CSF therapy is associated with decreased IDO activity and reduced kynurenine pathway catabolites in sepsis. This may be due to an improved antibacterial defence.

A circadian clock in macrophages controls inflammatory immune responses.	Time of day-dependent variations of immune system parameters are ubiquitous phenomena in immunology. The circadian clock has been attributed with coordinating these variations on multiple levels; however, their molecular basis is little understood. Here, we systematically investigated the link between the circadian clock and rhythmic immune functions. We show that spleen, lymph nodes, and peritoneal macrophages of mice contain intrinsic circadian clockworks that operate autonomously even ex vivo. These clocks regulate circadian rhythms in inflammatory innate immune functions: Isolated spleen cells stimulated with bacterial endotoxin at different circadian times display circadian rhythms in TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, we found that these rhythms are not driven by systemic glucocorticoid variations nor are they due to the detected circadian fluctuation in the cellular constitution of the spleen. Rather, a local circadian clock operative in splenic macrophages likely governs these oscillations as indicated by endotoxin stimulation experiments in rhythmic primary cell cultures. On the molecular level, we show that >8% of the macrophage transcriptome oscillates in a circadian fashion, including many important regulators for pathogen recognition and cytokine secretion. As such, understanding the cross-talk between the circadian clock and the immune system provides insights into the timing mechanism of physiological and pathophysiological immune functions.

Impaired insulin sensitivity as an underlying mechanism linking hepatitis C and posttransplant diabetes mellitus in kidney recipients.	Aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism/s associating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and posttransplant diabetes mellitus in kidney recipients. Twenty HCV-positive and 22 HCV-negative kidney recipients, 14 HCV-positive nontransplant patients and 24 HCV-negative nontransplant (healthy) subjects were analyzed. A 3-h intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed; peripheral insulin sensitivity was assessed by minimal modeling. Pancreatic insulin secretion, hepatic insulin uptake, pancreatic antibodies and proinflammatory cytokines in serum (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intereukin-6, high-sensitive C-reactive protein) were also assessed. HCV-positive recipients showed a significantly lower insulin sensitivity as compared to HCV-negative recipients (3.0 +/- 2.1 vs. 4.9 +/- 3.0 min(-1).microU.mL(- 1).10(4), p = 0.02), however, insulin secretion and hepatic insulin uptake were not significantly different. Pancreatic antibodies were negative in all. HCV status was an independent predictor of impaired insulin sensitivity (multivariate analysis, p = 0.008). The decrease of insulin sensitivity due to HCV was comparable for transplant and non-transplant subjects. No significant correlation was found between any of the cytokines and insulin sensitivity. Our results suggest that impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity is associated with HCV infection irrespective of the transplant status, and is the most likely pathogenic mechanism involved in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus associated with HCV infection.

The Th17 cytokine IL-22 induces IL-20 production in keratinocytes: a novel immunological cascade with potential relevance in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease. Recent studies demonstrated that IL-20 and IL-22, cytokines produced by keratinocytes and T cells, respectively, both inhibit keratinocyte terminal differentiation and induce psoriasis-like epidermis alterations. Here, we investigated the relationship between these mediators. Although IL-20 was not able to regulate IL-22 production, IL-22 induced IL-20 mRNA and protein in human keratinocytes. However, IL-22 had only a minimal effect, if any, on IL-19 and IL-26. Cutaneous IL-20 was also elevated in mice following IL-22 application. Accordingly, some of IL-22's effects on differentiation-regulating genes were partially mediated by an endogenous, secreted protein and attenuated by anti-IL-20 Ab. Like IL-22, IL-17A and TNF-alpha induced IL-20 in keratinocytes, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-20 itself did not. Furthermore, IL-17A and TNF-alpha individually strengthened the IL-22-induced IL-20 production. In lesional skin of psoriasis patients, highly elevated IL-20 levels strongly correlated with IL-22, and to a lesser extent, with IL-17A and TNF-alpha. As previously shown for IL-22, IL-20 blood levels correlated with the disease severity, although with a lower significance. This study demonstrates that a T-cell mediator induces a tissue cell mediator with similar effects to its own and therefore suggests the existence of a novel type of pathogenetic cascade.

Human bone marrow as a source to generate CMV-specific CD4+ T cells with multifunctional capacity.	The bone marrow (BM) is an important compartment for T cell memory. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive individuals peripheral blood (PB) CMV-specific T cells constitute a large fraction of PB T cells but are mostly differentiated effector/effector memory T cells with limited survival and proliferative potential. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the CMV-specific T cell response in BM studying both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against overlapping peptide pools of the CMV proteins pp65 and immediate early protein-1. CMV-specific T cell responses were characterized ex vivo and after in vitro expansion of paired PB/BM samples by multiparameter flow cytometry determining surface phenotype, cytokine profile, and cytotoxic capability. Comparable frequencies of CMV-specific T cells were found in un-manipulated PB and BM. Both total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could be more rapidly expanded from BM. Expanded BM T cells contained significantly higher frequencies of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells than PB. Furthermore, higher frequencies of specific CD4+ T cells from BM were multifunctional, characterized by simultaneous production of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-2. Use of BM may thus facilitate more rapid generation of adoptive T cells with enhanced functionality.

Generation of HCMV-specific T-cell lines from seropositive solid-organ-transplant recipients for adoptive T-cell therapy.	Chronically immunosuppressed patients, like solid-organ-transplant (SOT) recipients, are at increased risk for severe human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Despite the availability of effective antiviral drugs, lasting control of remaining viruses is dependent on an effective T-cell immunity. So in some patients conventional antiviral therapy cannot control the infection and prolonged virostatic therapy is limited by its side effects and the development of viral resistance. Selective reconstitution of cellular immunity by adoptive transfer of HCMV-specific T cells derived from healthy donors is a safe and effective approach in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to determine whether functional HCMV-specific T cells can also be generated from chronically immunosuppressed patients. Autologous CD4+/8+ T-cell lines directed against the HCMV protein IE-1 were generated from the peripheral blood of SOT patients using a recently developed modular protocol easily applicable to good-manufacturing-practice conditions. T-cell lines from SOT patients showed similar features as cells from healthy donors regarding phenotype, functionality (HCMV-specific killing, gene expression pattern, and cytokine secretion), IE-1 epitope recognition, and dominance of distinct T-cell receptor V beta families. Most importantly, this protocol also allowed the generation of T-cell lines from immunosuppressed patients with HCMV infection/chronic HCMV disease. Our data suggest the potential of this autologous approach for the treatment of SOT recipients suffering from HCMV infection/disease poorly responding to virostatic therapy.

PD-1 but not CTLA-4 blockage abrogates the protective effect of regulatory T cells in a pregnancy murine model.	"Regulatory T cells (Treg) play an important role in fetal protection. They expand during normal pregnancy and protect paternal/fetal antigens from rejection by maternal effector cells. Accordingly, the transfer of Treg obtained from BALB/c-mated CBA/J females prevents abortion in DBA/2J-mated animals. The actual mechanism through which Treg mediate their protective effect is still inconclusive. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) are some of known Treg-associated molecules; however, their role in Treg-mediated fetal protection in murine model has not been investigated.
Treg obtained from normal pregnant animals (NP; CBA/J x BALB/c) on day 14 were adoptively transferred into abortion-prone mice (AP; CBA/J x DBA/2J) intravenously on day 2 of pregnancy. An amount of 250 microg of either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 mAb were injected intraperitoneally on days 0, 3, 6 and 9 of pregnancy. Controls received Treg + IgG or Treg + PBS. NP or AP treated with PBS served as additional controls.
Blocking PD-1 abrogated the protective effect of Treg, resulting in a higher median abortion rate in comparison with the Treg/isotype-treated control while CTLA-4 blockage did not interfere with the protective effect of Treg. This was associated with a diminished number of vascular endothelial growth factor-A(+) cells, previously reported as stimulators of lymphocyte extravasation in preterm labor.
Our data suggest PD-1 as an important mediator in Treg-induced fetal protection in the CBA/J x DBA/2J murine model."

BCR-ABL positive cells and chronic myeloid leukemia in immune suppressed organ transplant recipients.	The constitutively activated tyrosine kinase activity of the p210(bcr-abl) fusion protein, generated by a t(9;22)(q34;q11) chromosomal translocation, is pathogenetically associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, mechanisms contributing to the expansion of a BCR-ABL positive clone are largely obscure. In the presence of an impaired immune surveillance, cells carrying any of these alterations may become phenotypically relevant. Therefore, immunosuppressed solid organ recipients represent an optimal population to investigate the frequency of mRNA products of this translocation. Blood leukocytes were studied in 201 individuals (100 organ recipients and 101 control individuals) for the presence of BCR-ABL transcripts by a nested-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, routinely used in our institution. In 5/100 immunosuppressed patients, at least one out of two RT-PCR products was bcr-abl positive while all controls were negative. These findings were extended by four CML cases of organ transplant recipients (three renal and one liver transplants). Three of these cases developed CML in a total of 2088 transplantations in 9 yr, suggesting a higher incidence of CML in these patients.

Despite IFN-lambda receptor expression, blood immune cells, but not keratinocytes or melanocytes, have an impaired response to type III interferons: implications for therapeutic applications of these cytokines.	Interferon (IFN)-lambda1, -2 and -3 (also designated as interleukin (IL)-29, IL-28alpha and IL-28beta) represent a new subfamily within the class II cytokine family. They show type I IFN-like antiviral and cytostatic activities in affected cells forming the basis for IFN-lambda1 therapy currently under development for hepatitis C infection. However, many aspects of IFN-lambdas are still unknown. This study aimed at identifying the target cells of IFN-lambdas within the immune system and the skin. Among skin cell populations, keratinocytes and melanocytes, but not fibroblasts, endothelial cells or subcutaneous adipocytes turned out to be targets. In contrast to these target cells, blood immune cell populations did not clearly respond to even high concentrations of these cytokines, despite an IFN-lambda receptor expression. Interestingly, immune cells expressed high levels of a short IFN-lambda receptor splice variant (sIFN-lambdaR1/sIL-28R1). Its characterization revealed a secreted, glycosylated protein that binds IFN-lambda1 with a moderate affinity (K(D) 73 nM) and was able to inhibit IFN-lambda1 effects. Our study suggests that IFN-lambda therapy should be suited for patients with verrucae, melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers, apart from patients with viral hepatitis, and would not be accompanied by immune-mediated complications known from type I IFN application.

Molecular phenotypes of acute rejection predict kidney graft prognosis.	Earlier detection of antibody-mediated rejection of kidney allografts may improve graft outcomes. Profiling of gene expression holds promise for the diagnosis and prognosis of antibody-mediated rejection. Here, we identified 730 patients who received kidney transplants during 2002-2005, including 21 patients (2.9%) who experienced early acute antibody-mediated rejection. We also identified a matched group of 43 patients with early acute T cell-mediated rejection to serve as controls. Compared with patients with T cell-mediated rejection, those with antibody-mediated rejection had significantly higher intrarenal mRNA expression of the cytoprotective heme oxygenase-1 but had lower expression of the regulatory T cell marker forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), the B cell marker CD20, and the chemokine regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). T cell infiltration was similar in both groups of patients. Compared with grafts that had a favorable course, those that failed as a result of antibody-mediated rejection had expression profiles suggesting a lack of regulation (less FoxP3, TGF-beta1, RANTES, and CD20). Grafts that failed as a result of T cell-mediated rejection only revealed lower expression of CD20 mRNA. In summary, these data suggest that severe antibody-mediated rejection and T cell-mediated rejection result in graft loss by distinct mechanisms. Molecular phenotypes of early acute rejection might help to identify grafts with poor prognosis, allowing earlier application of additional therapies.

Pretransplant immune risk assessment.	"Despite the introduction of advanced immunosuppressive drug therapies, clinical and subclinical rejections still occur in many graft recipients with a negative impact on the long-term transplant outcome. The immunological status of the patients awaiting the transplantation is a key factor for these processes. Here we summarize the recent efforts to identify and develop biomarkers and functional assays that allow an individual pretransplant risk assessment.
New sensitive techniques assessing T-cell memory and B-cell activation have been developed. Furthermore, the expression level of soluble and molecular markers reflecting the activation state of the immune system and donor graft intrinsic factors have been shown to influence graft outcome.
A variety of parameters and assays that determine the pretransplant immune activation status has been developed. Some of these assays have already been used prospectively to define high-risk patients receiving advanced immunosuppressive induction therapy.However, the conflicting results obtained in different studies show that biomarker analysis and functional assays performance need to be further standardized and validated in large prospective trials before they can be routinely implemented into a pretransplant risk assessment.

CXCL13 and CXCL12 in central nervous system lymphoma patients.	"Homing of malignant lymphocytes to the central nervous system (CNS) may play a role in the pathogenesis of CNS lymphoma. In this study, we evaluated the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL13 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with CNS lymphoma.
Samples from 30 patients with CNS lymphoma (23 with primary and 7 with secondary CNS lymphoma; all B-cell lymphoma) and 40 controls (10 patients with other CNS malignancies and 30 without a malignant CNS disease) were examined. CXCL12 and CXCL13 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The grade of blood-brain barrier disruption was estimated by the CSF/serum albumin ratio.
CNS lymphoma patients and controls did not differ in CXCL12 serum and CSF levels. Serum levels of CXCL13 were generally low. CXCL13 CSF levels, however, were significantly higher in CNS lymphoma patients as compared with controls (P < 0.0001). Chemokine levels in CSF and serum did not correlate. In CNS lymphoma, CXCL13 concentration in CSF correlated with the degree of blood-brain barrier disruption (R = 0.66; P = 0.003). Elevated CSF levels of CXCL12 and CXCL13 measured in seven CNS lymphoma patients during therapy decreased in five patients who responded to chemotherapy and increased in two with lymphoma progression.
Our results suggest a production of CXCL13 within the CNS of CNS lymphoma patients, which decreases with response to therapy. Thus, CXCL13 may represent a marker for further diagnostic and prognostic studies."

Exercise capacity and body composition in living-donor renal transplant recipients over time.	"Renal transplantation (RTx) restitutes the function of the failing organ and induces convalescence of the entire organism. Our study investigates whether this is accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular function and structural changes.
A total of 25 Caucasian patients (14 male, median age 44.2 +/- 9.2 years, BMI 23.7 +/- 4.0 kg/m(2)) were assessed in a prospective trial before, 1, 3 and 12 months after RTx from living donors by clinical examination, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and analysis of plasma indices.
Creatinine clearance improved from 8.0 +/- 3.1 to 60.9 +/- 18.1 mL/min at 1 month, but declined at 3 (51.6 +/- 16.3 mL/min) and 12 months (53.6 +/- 20.8 mL/min, P = 0.04 versus month 1). Body composition shifted from lean towards fat tissue (25.8 +/- 12.5-31.2 +/- 11.2% body fat content, P = 0.0001). Only baseline lean weight correlated with fat increase over time (r(2) = 0.28, P = 0.008). Patients with fat content above median (n = 13) had a 3-fold increased hazard ratio of infection (CI 1.04-9.41, P = 0.042) and overall hospitalization (hazard ratio 2.95, CI 1.10-7.93, P = 0.03). PeakVO(2) decreased over RTx (23.2 +/- 6.0- 17.6 +/- 5.1 mL/kg/min) and returned to baseline levels not until 1 year later (P < 0.001). After an initial decline, muscle oxidative capacity (peakVO(2)/lean mass) improved from 33.6 +/- 10.1 to 35.0 +/- 8.2 mL/kg/min at 12 months after RTx (P < 0.001).
After RTx, body composition shifted continuously towards fat tissue, and baseline lean weight significantly correlated with fat increase over time. Both severe infections and hospitalizations are associated with a higher fat content before RTx. Exercise capacity (peakVO(2)) worsened after RTx and restitutes during follow-up, with muscle quality (peakVO(2)/lean) even exceeding baseline levels after 12 months."

Lymphocyte markers and prediction of long-term renal allograft acceptance.	"Long-term allograft acceptance is the main goal of posttransplant care. Modern immunosuppression has reduced the incidence of acute rejection, the major risk factor for long-term allograft survival, and improved the 1-year results, despite increasing use of marginal donor organs. However, the long-term results are still unsatisfactory. Chronic allograft injury and side effects of chronic immunosuppression are the main causes. Therefore, preemptive reduced long-term immunosuppression is required. Present 'trial-and-error' strategies appear to be remarkably harmful for patients not suitable for partial drug weaning. In addition, preemptive interventions have been shown to be the only successful strategy for improving the long-term transplant outcome in animal models. These findings underline the importance of early identification of biomarkers in detecting the individual's risk.
Recent technological advances have provided evidence of successful approaches to this goal. A set of parameters/tests are showing promise for guiding personalized immunosuppression, including different technology platforms such as antidonor responsiveness/nonresponsiveness, cellular parameters predicting risk of virus-associated complications, gene expression analysis etc.
Although the data are very promising, multicentric, prospective, randomized clinical trials are crucial prerequisites for introducing immune monitoring into routine clinical use. International networks, such as RISET and ITN, can help to facilitate this process."

Symptomatic lymphoceles after kidney transplantation - multivariate analysis of risk factors and outcome after laparoscopic fenestration.	Lymphocele formation is a common complication after kidney transplantation, and laparoscopic surgery has become a widely accepted treatment option. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the risk factors of lymphocele development and to assess the treatment outcome after laparoscopic fenestration. We analyzed 426 renal allograft recipients operated between 2002 and 2006 receiving triple immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors. The incidence of lymphocele was 9.9%, while 24 (5.6%) patients with symptomatic lymphoceles required laparoscopic surgery. Serum creatinine at diagnosis was significantly higher in patients with lymphoceles treated surgically (3.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.6 mg/dL; p < 0.001). After successful laparoscopic intervention, creatinine concentrations recovered until discharge and were comparable to other patients (1.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.5 mg/dL; p = NS). While we observed a significant association of lymphocele formation with diabetes, tacrolimus therapy, and acute rejection in univariate testing, only diabetes remained a significant factor after multivariate analysis. Laparoscopic fenestration proved to be a safe and efficient method without any associated mortality and a low recurrence rate of 8.3% (n = 2). We conclude that diabetes is an independent risk factor for lymphocele development, and laparoscopic fenestration should be the treatment of choice for larger and symptomatic lymphoceles, as it is safe and offers a low recurrence rate.

Immunization of liver and renal transplant recipients: a seroepidemiological and sociodemographic survey.	Several life-threatening infections, a major risk to adult solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients on immunosuppressive therapy, can be prevented by immunization. We analyzed sociodemographic parameters and the immunization status of adult liver transplant recipients (LTX-R, n=267) and renal transplant recipients (RTX-R, n=197) SOT recipients at the Transplantation Center, Berlin, Germany. Date, number, and provider of recommended vaccines were recorded and seroprotection rates determined. The social status in both groups was similar. Most patients (89%) were not adequately informed about immunizations; and if informed, main sources were physicians (47%) and the media (40%). Vaccinations were predominantly provided by family doctors (LTX-R, 66%; RTX-R, 31%) or hemodialysis centers (RTX-R, 37%). Before transplantation, RTX-R had significantly more often received booster vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria (P<0.005), and a primary hepatitis B immunization (55%); whereas in LTX-R, post-transplant vaccinations against hepatitis A (16%) and pneumococcal disease (13%) were more frequent. Seroprotection rates against tetanus were fairly high in LTX-R (85.3%) and RTX-R (86.8%), and considerably lower for diphtheria, hepatitis A, and influenza. Immunization rates are too low in SOT recipients. Improvement will depend on a more active role of health care providers.

Expression of tolerance associated gene-1, a mitochondrial protein inhibiting T cell activation, can be used to predict response to immune modulating therapies.	Immune modulating therapies gain increasing importance in treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. None of the currently applied biologics achieves significant clinical improvement in all treated patients. Because the therapy with biologics is cost intensive and sometimes associated with side effects, noninvasive diagnostic tools for early prediction of responders are of major interest. We studied the effects of Alefacept (LFA3Ig), an approved drug for treatment of psoriasis, on leukocytes in vitro and in vivo to identify gene markers predictive for treatment response and to further investigate its molecular mechanisms of action. In an open-label study, 20 psoriasis patients were treated weekly with 15 mg Alefacept over 12 wk. We demonstrate that transcription of the tolerance-associated gene (TOAG-1) is significantly up-regulated whereas receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated migration (RHAMM) transcription is down-regulated in PBMCs of responding patients before clinical improvement. TOAG-1 is exclusively localized within mitochondria. Overexpression of TOAG-1 in murine T cells leads to increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Addition of Alefacept to stimulated human T cells in vitro resulted in reduced frequencies of activated CD137(+) cells, increased TOAG-1 but reduced RHAMM expression. This was accompanied by reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Inhibition of proliferation was dependent on enhanced PDL1 expression of APCs. Thus, peripheral changes of TOAG-1 and RHAMM expression can be used to predict clinical response to Alefacept treatment in psoriasis patients. In the presence of APCs Alefacept can inhibit T cell activation and survival by increasing expression of TOAG-1 on T cells and PDL1 on APCs.

Treatment of PTLD with rituximab and CHOP reduces the risk of renal graft impairment after reduction of immunosuppression.	We addressed the effect of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) treatment with rituximab monotherapy or CHOP-based chemotherapy (+/- rituximab) after upfront immunosuppression reduction (IR) on renal graft function in a longitudinal analysis of 58 renal transplant recipients with PTLD and 610 renal transplant controls. Changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate over time were calculated from a total of 6933 creatinine measurements over a period of >1 year using a linear mixed model with random and fixed effects. Renal graft function significantly improved with treatment of PTLD, especially in the chemotherapy subgroup. Patients treated with IR+chemotherapy +/- rituximab had a noninferior graft function compared with untreated controls suggesting that the negative impact of IR on the renal graft function can be fully compensated by the immunosuppressive effect of CHOP. The immunosuppressive effect of single agent rituximab may partially compensate the negative impact of IR on the graft function. Thus, it is possible to reduce immunosuppression when using chemotherapy to treat PTLD.

Leukocyte redistribution: effects of beta blockers in patients with chronic heart failure.	"Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a well established factor in the progression of chronic heart failure (CHF). Changes in cellular immunity have not been widely studied, and the impact of standard medication is uncertain. Here we investigate whether a leukocyte redistribution occurs in CHF and whether this effect is influenced by beta-blocker therapy.
We prospectively studied 75 patients with systolic CHF (age: 68+/-11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 32+/-11%, New York Heart Association class 2.5+/-0.7) and 20 age-matched healthy control subjects (age: 63+/-10 years). We measured the response of cells to endotoxin exposure in vitro, analysed subsets of lymphocytes using flow cytometry, and assessed plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory markers interleukin 1, 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and 2.
While no differences in the number of leukocytes were noted between patients with CHF and healthy controls, we detected relative lymphopenia in patients with CHF (p<0.001 vs. control), mostly driven by reductions in T helper cells and B cells (both p<0.05). The number of neutrophils was increased (p<0.01). These effects were pronounced in patients who were beta-blocker naïve (32% of all patients with CHF). Increased plasma levels of soluble tumor necrosis receptor-1 correlated with the relative number of lymphocyte subsets.
In patients with CHF, we detected a redistribution of leukocyte subsets, i.e. an increase in neutrophils with relative lymphopenia.

Phenotype changes and impaired function of dendritic cell subsets in patients with sepsis: a prospective observational analysis.	"Patients with sepsis often demonstrate severely impaired immune responses. The hallmark of this state of immunoparalysis is monocytic deactivation characterized by decreased human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, diminished numbers of dendritic cells (DCs) were reported in patients with sepsis. However, little is known about DC phenotype and function in human sepsis. We therefore compared phenotypic and functional changes in monocyte and DC subsets in patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis.
In a prospective observational analysis, 16 consecutive patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (age 59.2 +/- 9.7 years, 13 male, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 6.1 +/- 2.7) and immunoparalysis (monocytic HLA-DR expression < 5,000 antibodies/cell) and 16 healthy volunteers were included. Peripheral blood DC counts, HLA-DR expression and ex vivo cytokine production were evaluated in comparison with monocyte subsets over time.
At baseline, a profound reduction in the numbers of myeloid DCs (MDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs), and CD14dimCD16positive monocytes was observed in sepsis whereas CD14brightCD16negative and CD14brightCD16positive monocyte numbers were increased. HLA-DR expression was reduced on all monocyte and DC subsets. Production of proinflammatory cytokines and intracellular cytokine staining in response to lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid was impaired in monocyte subsets and MDCs, whereas IL-10 secretion was increased. IFNalpha response by stimulated PDCs was significantly decreased compared with controls. At day 28, HLA-DR expression and cytokine production of DC and monocyte subsets remained lower in septic patients compared with controls.
In sepsis, long-lasting functional deactivation is common to all circulating monocyte and DC subsets. In addition to decreased peripheral blood DC counts, functional impairment of antigen-presenting cells may contribute to an impaired antimicrobial defense in sepsis."

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor to reverse sepsis-associated immunosuppression: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial.	"Sustained sepsis-associated immunosuppression is associated with uncontrolled infection, multiple organ dysfunction, and death.
In the first controlled biomarker-guided immunostimulatory trial in sepsis, we tested whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) reverses monocyte deactivation, a hallmark of sepsis-associated immunosuppression (primary endpoint), and improves the immunological and clinical course of patients with sepsis.
In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, 38 patients (19/group) with severe sepsis or septic shock and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (monocytic HLA-DR [mHLA-DR] <8,000 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) per cell for 2 d) were treated with GM-CSF (4 microg/kg/d) or placebo for 8 days. The patients' clinical and immunological course was followed up for 28 days.
Both groups showed comparable baseline mHLA-DR levels (5,609 +/- 3,628 vs. 5,659 +/- 3,332 mAb per cell), which significantly increased within 24 hours in the GM-CSF group. After GM-CSF treatment, mHLA-DR was normalized in 19/19 treated patients, whereas this occurred in 3/19 control subjects only (P < 0.001). GM-CSF also restored ex-vivo Toll-like receptor 2/4-induced proinflammatory monocytic cytokine production. In patients receiving GM-CSF, a shorter time of mechanical ventilation (148 +/- 103 vs. 207 +/- 58 h, P = 0.04), an improved Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score (P = 0.02), and a shorter length of both intrahospital and intensive care unit stay was observed (59 +/- 33 vs. 69 +/- 46 and 41 +/- 26 vs. 52 +/- 39 d, respectively, both not significant). Side effects related to the intervention were not noted.
Biomarker-guided GM-CSF therapy in sepsis is safe and effective for restoring monocytic immunocompetence. Use of GM-CSF may shorten the time of mechanical ventilation and hospital/intensive care unit stay.

Sustained BK viruria as an early marker for the development of BKV-associated nephropathy: analysis of 4128 urine and serum samples.	"BKV reactivation plays the causative role in the development of BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN). Because of the lack of effective therapy, early diagnosis of BKV reactivation is paramount for the prevention of BKVAN. Resting in uroepithelial cells, BKV is excreted first in urine before it can be detected in plasma. The present study analyzed predictive value of BK viruria for the development of BK viremia and its possible advantage for the early BKVAN prediction.
Total of 4128 urine and serum samples obtained from renal transplant patients were analyzed for BKV positivity by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 433 patients in cross-sectional and in 233 patients in longitudinal manner, respectively. The prospective longitudinal analysis included seven measurements during the first posttransplant year.
A total of 7% and 19% patients were positive for BKV in serum and urine, respectively. Sustained BK viruria showed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94% for BK viremia and was associated with significantly higher level of BK load than the patients with transient viruria (P<0.01). Interestingly, BK viremia was preceded by BK viruria: the peak of viral load and number of positive patients appeared during the third and fifth posttransplant month for urine and serum, respectively. BKVAN diagnosed in 21.4% of patient with persistent BK viruria appeared 5 and 11 weeks after BKV reactivation in serum and urine, respectively, was detected.
Sustained BK viruria is a reliable marker allowing an early identification of patients at high risk of BKVAN development and therefore assure precocious therapeutic interventions."

Clinical manifestation of mannose-binding lectin deficiency in adults independent of concomitant immunodeficiency.	Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) mediates important functions within the innate immune system, and its deficiency was associated with infectious complications. However, in adults without concomitant immunodeficiency the clinical relevance of MBL deficiency remains controversial. We analyzed the distribution of MBL deficiency and its association with concomitant immunodeficiency in 228 adult Caucasian patients with a history of recurrent and/or severe infections. Two hundred forty-one unrelated Caucasians without recurrent or severe infections served as control subjects. The frequency of severe MBL deficiency (plasma levels <or= 50 ng/ml) was significantly higher in patients with a history of recurrent and/or severe infections (p < 0.05, odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.1), and this association was independent of concomitant antibody or cellular immunodeficiency. Our data challenge the view that MBL deficiency in adulthood becomes relevant only in individuals who are immunocompromised for other reasons.

High weight differences between donor and recipient affect early kidney graft function--a role for enhanced IL-6 signaling.	The frequency of delayed function of kidney transplants varies greatly and is associated with quality of graft, donor age and the duration of cold ischemia time. Furthermore, body weight differences between donor and recipient can affect primary graft function, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We transplanted kidney grafts from commensurate body weight (L-WD) or reduced body weight (H-WD) donor rats into syngeneic or allogeneic recipients. Twenty-four hours posttransplantation, serum creatinine levels in H-WD recipients were significantly higher compared to L-WD recipients indicating impaired primary graft function. This was accompanied by upregulation of IL-6 transcription and increased tubular destruction in grafts from H-WD recipients. Using DNA microarray analysis, we detected decreased expression of genes associated with kidney function and an upregulation of other genes such as Cyp3a13, FosL and Trib3. A single application of IL-6 into L-WD recipients is sufficient to impair primary graft function and cause tubular damage, whereas immediate neutralization of IL-6 receptor signaling in H-WD recipients rescued primary graft function with well-preserved kidney graft architecture and a normalized gene expression profile. These findings have strong clinical implication as anti-IL6R treatment of patients receiving grafts from lower-weight donors could be used to improve primary graft function.

Small interfering RNA targeting heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) reinforces liver apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice: HO-1 is necessary for cytoprotection.	We have shown that overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) prevents the liver inflammation response leading to ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI). This study was designed to explore the precise function and mechanism of HO-1 cytoprotection in liver IRI by employing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) that effectively suppresses HO-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. Using a partial lobar liver warm ischemia model, mice were injected with HO-1 siRNA/nonspecific control siRNA or Ad-HO-1/Ad-beta-gal. Those treated with HO-1 siRNA showed increased serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase levels, significant liver edema, sinusoidal congestion/cytoplasmic vacuolization, and severe hepatocellular necrosis. In contrast, Ad-HO-1-pretreated animals revealed only minimal sinusoidal congestion without edema/vacuolization or necrosis. Administration of HO-1 siRNA significantly increased local neutrophil accumulation and the frequency of apoptotic cells. Mice treated with HO-1 siRNA were characterized by increased caspase-3 activity and reduced HO-1 expression, whereas those given Ad-HO-1 showed decreased caspase-3 activity and increased HO-1/Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L), data confirmed by use of an in vitro cell culture system.

Can we use biomarkers and functional assays to implement personalized therapies in transplantation?	Research in transplantation focuses on minimizing immunosuppression to decrease side effects and costs. Indeed, in some patients, partial or complete cessation of immunosuppression is successful, but currently we have no means of identifying suitable patients a priori. Current withdrawal protocols, which do not implement surrogate markers, carry a significant risk of graft injury. To minimize the risk, immune monitoring strategies are required. Here, we review recently described biomarkers and assays, which might enable identification of patients suitable for partial or complete weaning and patients at risk of rejection. The predictive power of these parameters has to be tested in prospective multicenter trials.

Anti-human leukocyte antigen and donor-specific antibodies detected by luminex posttransplant serve as biomarkers for chronic rejection of renal allografts.	"Although the incidence of early acute rejection could have been diminished in the past, the long-term renal allograft survival could not benefit from the introduction of more effective immunosuppressive regimens mainly aiming at cellular rejection mechanisms. The cause of chronic rejection is still discussed controversially. Here, we demonstrate to what extent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (HLAab) posttransplant contribute to late graft outcome.
A total of 1014 deceased kidney transplant recipients transplanted at the Charité hospital were monitored in a cross-sectional manner for the development of HLAab using Luminex Single Antigen beads. Patients with stable kidney function at a median of 5-years posttransplant were tested once for HLAab and monitored for 5.5 years after testing.
Thirty percent of recipients showed HLAab. Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) were found in 31% of antibody positive patients. The presence of DSA was associated with a significantly lower graft survival of 49% vs. 83% in the HLAab negative group (P< or =0.0001). Non-DSAs also had an adverse effect on graft survival (70% vs. 83%; P=0.0001). In a prospective analysis of 195 patients with repeatedly no detectable HLAab, the survival probability was 94% as opposed to 79% survival among patients who developed HLAab de novo after the first testing (P=0.05).
We confirmed that HLAab produced even late after transplantation are detrimental to graft outcome. DSA were proven to have a strong adverse impact on graft survival. The results indicate that a posttransplant HLAab monitoring routine could be appropriate to improve long-term results."

Adoptive T-cell therapy of a lung transplanted patient with severe CMV disease and resistance to antiviral therapy.	Infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) can induce severe complications after transplantation, particularly in patients resistant to virostatic therapy. Adoptive transfer of CMV-specific T-cell lines has demonstrated promising results in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the generation of specific T-cell lines ex vivo and their function in vivo is complicated in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Here, we present the successful adoptive transfer of autologous CMV-specific T cells to a lung transplant recipient with ganciclovir-resistant CMV-pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Infused T cells rapidly expanded in vivo and efficiently inhibited viral replication as confirmed by extensive longitudinal immunological monitoring. After full recovery, the patient was released from the clinic. After 4 weeks, the infection reappeared and persisted at a low level even after a second T-cell infusion. Our experimental data indicate that this could be the consequence of the late differentiated phenotype of the infused T cells and therefore their insufficient longevity in vivo. In summary, our report signifies the high therapeutic potential of adoptive immunotherapy in the treatment of SOT recipients when all other measures show no effect. Further studies have to elucidate the most potent strategies to generate antigen-specific T cells with high functional capacity and robust long-term persistence.

Diagnostic value of T-cell monitoring assays in kidney transplantation.	"Personalized immunosuppressive therapy on the basis of the recognition of individual alloreactive and anti-infectious immune responses is a major goal in clinical transplantation. It requires the development of reliable assays for quantification of T-cell responses. Here, we review recent findings in the field of T-cell immune monitoring focusing on candidate assays with clinical utility for predicting outcome in kidney transplantation.
Promising assays for routine monitoring of T-cell reactivity in transplant patients include IFNgamma Elispot, multiparameter flow cytometry and intracellular ATP assay. Although large randomized multicenter studies are still lacking, first clinical applications have demonstrated remarkable differences in alloreactive and anti-infectious T-cell reactivity of transplant patients with potential for predicting outcome. Currently, standardization of the tests is a major challenge for translation into multicenter trials.
A definitive picture of the (allo)immune response would require the assessment of multiple biological and genetic markers. However, frequent and reliable T-cell monitoring is feasible by simple cellular assays such as IFNgamma Elispot and intracellular ATP determination. International efforts are warranted for further standardization of these assays. Furthermore, the implementation of T-cell monitoring assays in large randomized clinical studies assessing different immunosuppressive regimens and weaning procedures is clearly required."

IL-10 protects monocytes and macrophages from complement-mediated lysis.	Phagocytes, such as monocytes and macrophages, are important cells of the innate immunity in the defense against microbes. So far, it is unclear how these cells survive at the site of combat against microbes, where a hostile inflammatory environment prevails with strong complement activity. We hypothesized that IL-10, a key cytokine involved in the resolution of inflammation, induces resistance to complement attack. Here, we demonstrate for the first time such a cell-protective effect of IL-10 on human monocytes and macrophages. IL-10 is indeed able to protect these cell types in an in vitro model of complement lysis triggered by an anti-MHCI antibody or by binding of zymosan. Investigating potential underlying mechanisms, we found that IL-10 up-regulated the expression of complement regulatory membrane protein CD59 and the general cell-protective stress protein HO-1 in human monocytes. However, further functional analysis failed to link these individual IL-10-mediated effects with the increased protection from complement lysis. Blocking the protective effect of CD59 with an antibody increased complement lysis but did not abrogate the IL-10-protective effect. Interestingly, chemical interference with HO-1 activity did abrogate the protective effect of IL-10, but siRNA-mediated knockdown of HO-1 did not confirm this observation. Our results suggest that IL-10 generates pathogen-clearing phagocytes, which are resistant to complement lysis and thereby, enabled to survive longer in a hostile inflammatory environment.

Human chorionic gonadotropin attracts regulatory T cells into the fetal-maternal interface during early human pregnancy.	Regulatory T cells (Treg) expand during pregnancy and are present at the fetal-maternal interface at very early stages in pregnancy. The migration mechanisms of Treg to the pregnant uterus are still unclear. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is secreted by the blastocyst immediately after fertilization and has chemoattractant properties. Therefore, we sought to analyze whether hCG secreted by early trophoblasts attracts Treg to the uterus and hence contributes to maternal tolerance toward the fetus. Decidua and placenta tissue samples from patients having spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancies were employed to evaluate Treg and hCG levels. Age-matched samples from normal pregnant women served as controls. We further performed in vitro studies with primary first trimester trophoblast cells and a choriocarcinoma cell line (JEG-3) aiming to evaluate the ability of secreted hCG to attract Treg. Patients having miscarriages or ectopic pregnancy presented significantly decreased hCG mRNA and protein levels associated with decreased Foxp3, neuropilin-1, IL-10, and TGF-beta mRNA levels as compared with normal pregnant women. Using migration assays we demonstrated that Treg were attracted by hCG-producing trophoblasts or choriocarcinoma cells. Treg migration toward cells transfected with hCG expression vectors confirmed the chemoattractant ability of hCG. Our data clearly show that hCG produced by trophoblasts attracts Treg to the fetal-maternal interface. High hCG levels at very early pregnancy stages ensure Treg to migrate to the site of contact between paternal Ags and maternal immune cells and to orchestrate immune tolerance toward the fetus.

Potent early immune response after kidney transplantation in patients of the European senior transplant program.	"The increasing age of organ donors and the transplantation of older recipients have become clinical practice. Age-adapted immunosuppressive protocols considering these changes are currently not established. This study analyzed the age-dependent immune response after human kidney transplantation.
One hundred renal allograft recipients were prospectively evaluated from 2004 to 2005. Patients older than 65 years of the European Senior Program receiving kidneys from donors older than 65 years were compared with recipients younger than 65 years receiving kidneys from donors younger than 65 years. Age-dependent modifications of the immune response were evaluated before transplantation and 7 days and 6 months after grafting by flow cytometry analysis of lymphocyte surface markers in peripheral blood. The cytokine pattern was determined by Cytometric Bead Array, T-cell alloreactivity by enzyme-linked immunospot analysis.
There were no differences between the groups regarding patient survival, graft survival, and function at 6 months after transplantation. Before transplantation, 7 days and 6 months thereafter recipients older than 65 years demonstrated significantly elevated numbers of memory T-cells while counts for naive T-cells were significantly reduced. Numbers of activated cytotoxic cells were elevated with increasing age before and 7 days after transplantation. T-cell alloreactivity was more pronounced in older recipients at all time points. Seven days after transplantation tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were significantly higher, whereas TNF-alpha and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations were significantly reduced after 6 months in older recipients.
Our data demonstrate an initially pronounced immune response in elderly recipients receiving grafts from elderly donors. This observation supports the concept of a donor and recipient age-adapted immunosuppression."

IL-22 and IL-20 are key mediators of the epidermal alterations in psoriasis while IL-17 and IFN-gamma are not.	Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disease with a largely unknown pathogenesis. We demonstrate here that transgenic over-expression of interleukin (IL)-22 in mice resulted in neonatal mortality and psoriasis-like skin alterations including acanthosis and hypogranularity. This cutaneous phenotype may be caused by the direct influence of IL-22 on keratinocytes, since this cytokine did not affect skin fibroblasts, endothelial cells, melanocytes, or adipocytes. The comparison of cytokines with hypothesized roles in psoriasis pathogenesis determined that neither interferon (IFN)-gamma nor IL-17, but only IL-22 and, with lower potency, IL-20 caused psoriasis-like morphological changes in a three-dimensional human epidermis model. These changes were associated with inhibited keratinocyte terminal differentiation and with STAT3 upregulation. The IL-22 effect on differentiation-regulating genes was STAT3-dependent. In contrast to IL-22 and IL-20, IFN-gamma and IL-17 strongly induced T-cell and neutrophilic granulocyte-attracting chemokines, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha potently induced diverse chemokines and additionally enhanced the expression of IL-22 receptor pathway elements and amplified some IL-22 effects. This study suggests that different cytokines are players in the psoriasis pathogenesis although only the IL-10 family members IL-22 and IL-20 directly cause the characteristic epidermal alterations.

The influence of recovery and training phases on body composition, peripheral vascular function and immune system of professional soccer players.	Professional soccer players have a lengthy playing season, throughout which high levels of physical stress are maintained. The following recuperation period, before starting the next pre-season training phase, is generally considered short but sufficient to allow a decrease in these stress levels and therefore a reduction in the propensity for injury or musculoskeletal tissue damage. We hypothesised that these physical extremes influence the body composition, blood flow, and endothelial/immune function, but that the recuperation may be insufficient to allow a reduction of tissue stress damage. Ten professional football players were examined at the end of the playing season, at the end of the season intermission, and after the next pre-season endurance training. Peripheral blood flow and body composition were assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography and DEXA scanning respectively. In addition, selected inflammatory and immune parameters were analysed from blood samples. Following the recuperation period a significant decrease of lean body mass from 74.4+/-4.2 kg to 72.2+/-3.9 kg was observed, but an increase of fat mass from 10.3+/-5.6 kg to 11.1+/-5.4 kg, almost completely reversed the changes seen in the pre-season training phase. Remarkably, both resting and post-ischemic blood flow (7.3+/-3.4 and 26.0+/-6.3 ml/100 ml/min) respectively, were strongly reduced during the playing and training stress phases, but both parameters increased to normal levels (9.0+/-2.7 and 33.9+/-7.6 ml/100 ml/min) during the season intermission. Recovery was also characterized by rising levels of serum creatinine, granulocytes count, total IL-8, serum nitrate, ferritin, and bilirubin. These data suggest a compensated hypo-perfusion of muscle during the playing season, followed by an intramuscular ischemia/reperfusion syndrome during the recovery phase that is associated with muscle protein turnover and inflammatory endothelial reaction, as demonstrated by iNOS and HO-1 activation, as well as IL-8 release. The data provided from this study suggest that the immune system is not able to function fully during periods of high physical stress. The implications of this study are that recuperation should be carefully monitored in athletes who undergo intensive training over extended periods, but that these parameters may also prove useful for determining an individual's risk of tissue stress and possibly their susceptibility to progressive tissue damage or injury.

IL-10 interferes directly with TCR-induced IFN-gamma but not IL-17 production in memory T cells.	IL-10 is a potent immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine. However, therapeutic trials in chronic inflammation have been largely disappointing. It is well established that IL-10 can inhibit Th1 and Th2 cytokine production via indirect effects on APC. Less data are available about the influence of IL-10 on IL-17 production, a cytokine which has been recently linked to chronic inflammation. Furthermore, there are only few reports about a direct effect of IL-10 on T cells. We demonstrate here that IL-10 can directly interfere with TCR-induced IFN-gamma production in freshly isolated memory T cells in the absence of APC. This effect was independent of the previously described effects of IL-10 on T cells, namely inhibition of IL-2 production and inhibition of CD28 signaling. In contrast, IL-10 did not affect anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced IL-17 production from memory T cells even in the presence of APC. This might have implications for the interpretation of therapeutic trials in patients with chronic inflammation where Th17 cells contribute to pathogenesis.

Targeting of natural killer cells by rabbit antithymocyte globulin and campath-1H: similar effects independent of specificity.	T cell depleting strategies are an integral part of immunosuppressive regimens widely used in the hematological and solid organ transplant setting. Although it is known to induce lymphocytopenia, little is known about the effects of the polyclonal rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) or the monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab on Natural Killer (NK) cells in detail. Here, we demonstrate that induction therapy with rATG following kidney/pancreas transplantation results in a rapid depletion of NK cells. Treatment of NK cells with rATG and alemtuzumab in vitro leads to impairment of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis even at a 10-fold lower concentration (0.1 microg/ml) compared with T and B cells. By generating Fc-parts of rATG and alemtuzumab we illustrate that their ligation to FcgammaRIII (CD16) is sufficient for the significant induction of degranulation, apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine release (FasL, TNFalpha and IFNgamma) exclusively in CD3(-)CD56(dim) NK cells whereas application of rATG and alemtuzumab F(ab) fragments abolishes these effects. These findings are of general importance as our data suggest that NK cells are also mediators of the clinically relevant cytokine release syndrome and that their targeting by therapeutic antibodies should be considered as they are functionally relevant for the effective clearance of opportunistic viral infections and anti-tumor activity posttransplantation.

Low immunogenicity of endothelial derivatives from rat embryonic stem cell-like cells.	Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are suggested to be immune-privileged, but they carry the risk of uncontrolled expansion and malignancy. Upon differentiation they lose their tumor-forming capacity, but they become immunogenic by the expression of a normal set of MHC molecules. This immunogenicity might trigger rejection after application in regenerative therapies. In this study MHC expression of and immune responses to endothelial derivatives of rat embryonic stem cell-like cells (RESC) under inflammatory conditions were determined in comparison to primary rat aortic endothelial cells (ECs). Cellular as well as humoral allo-recognition was analyzed in vitro. In addition, immune reactions in vivo were assessed by allo-antibody production and determination of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-secreting allo-reactive T cells. RESC derivatives expressed low but significant levels of MHC class I, and no MHC class II. In response to IFNgamma MHC class I expression was enhanced, while class II transactivator induction failed completely in these cells; MHC class II expression remained consistently absent. Functionally, the RESC derivatives showed a reduced allo-stimulatory capacity, protection against humoral allo-recognition in vitro and a slightly diminished susceptibility to cytotoxic T cell lysis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that these cells do not trigger host immune reactions, characterized by no allo-antibody production and no induction of allo-reactive memory T cells. Our results show that endothelial derivatives of RESC have a distinctive reduced immunogenic potency even under inflammatory conditions.

Increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity and elevated serum levels of tryptophan catabolites in patients with chronic kidney disease: a possible link between chronic inflammation and uraemic symptoms.	"Tryptophan (Trp) is catabolized by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Changes in Trp metabolism and IDO activity in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been widely studied, and the impact of haemodialysis is uncertain. Here we investigate Trp catabolism, IDO activity and the role of inflammation in moderate to very severe CKD and haemodialysis.
Eighty individuals were included in a prospective blinded endpoint analysis. Using tandem mass spectrometry, serum levels of Trp, kynurenine (Kyn), kynurenic-acid (Kyna), quinolinic-acid (Quin), 5-hydroxytryptophan (OH-Trp), serotonin (5-HT), estimated IDO activity and inflammatory markers were assessed in 40 CKD patients (age 57 +/- 14 years, 21 male, creatinine 4.5 +/- 2.7, n = 17 receiving haemodialysis), and in 40 healthy controls (age 34 +/- 9 years, 26 male).
Trp levels were unchanged in CKD (P = 0.78 versus controls). Serum levels of Kyn, Kyna and Quin increased with CKD severity (stages 4, 5 versus controls all P < or = 0.01). IDO activity was significantly induced in CKD and correlated with disease severity (stages 3-5 versus controls, all P < or = 0.01) and inflammatory markers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), soluble TNF-receptor-1 (sTNFR-I); both P < or = 0.03]. IDO products (Kyn, Kyna, Quin) correlated also with hsCRP and sTNFR-I (all P < or = 0.04). Haemodialysis did not influence IDO activity (P = 0.26) and incompletely removed Kyn, Kyna, Quin, OH-Trp and 5-HT by 22, 26, 50, 44 and 34%, respectively. In multiple regression, IDO activity correlated with hsCRP and sTNFR-I (both P < or = 0.03) independent of serum creatinine, age and body weight.
IDO activity and serum levels of tryptophan catabolites of the kynurenine pathway increase with CKD severity. In CKD, induction of IDO may primarily be a consequence of chronic inflammation."

The relationship between tumor necrosis factor-α, brain natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with chronic heart failure.	"Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) contribute to cardiac dysfunction in chronic heart failure (CHF). Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are thought to reflect cardiac functional and structural damage.
To study the relationship between BNP, ANP, and TNF, these parameters were measured in fasting venous blood samples of 25 CHF patients (age 66+/-2 years, pVO(2) 17.4+/-2.1 mL/kg/min, NYHA class 2.8+/-0.2, all mean+/-SEM) and 8 healthy controls (age 71+/-2 years). Patients with CHF had higher plasma levels of BNP (p<0.05), ANP (p<0.05), norepinephrine (p<0.01), and echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD, p<0.05) compared to controls, whereas TNF and epinephrine were not significantly different. There were significant correlations between natriuretic peptides and markers of inflammation and myocardial dysfunction in CHF patients: BNP vs. TNF (r=0.64, p=0.0006), vs. LVEDD (r=0.59, p=0.0025); ANP vs. TNF (r=0.60, p=0.0016), vs. LVEDD (r=0.65, p=0.0006); TNF vs. LVEDD (r=0.57, p=0.004). After adjustment for NYHA, creatinine clearance, and age TNF correlated with BNP (all p=0.01) and ANP (all p<0.002). The cachectic CHF patients (n=7,>6% weight loss) had the highest BNP (p<0.001 vs. controls, p<0.05 vs. non-cachectic CHF) and ANP levels (p=0.01 vs. controls). Concentrations of uric acid, epinephrine, and norepinephrine also correlated with ANP and BNP.
In CHF, TNF is closely related to BNP and ANP (independently of CHF severity and ventricular dysfunction), particularly in patients with cardiac cachexia. TNF may causally contribute to intrinsic cardiac dysfunction thereby stimulating BNP and ANP secretion."

Quantitative DNA methylation analysis of FOXP3 as a new method for counting regulatory T cells in peripheral blood and solid tissue.	Regulatory T-cells (Treg) have been the focus of immunologic research due to their role in establishing tolerance for harmless antigens versus allowing immune responses against foes. Increased Treg frequencies measured by mRNA expression or protein synthesis of the Treg marker FOXP3 were found in various cancers, indicating that dysregulation of Treg levels contributes to tumor establishment. Furthermore, they constitute a key target of immunomodulatory therapies in cancer as well as transplantation settings. One core obstacle for understanding the role of Treg, thus far, is the inability of FOXP3 mRNA or protein detection methods to differentiate between Treg and activated T cells. These difficulties are aggravated by the technical demands of sample logistics and processing. Based on Treg-specific DNA demethylation within the FOXP3 locus, we present a novel method for monitoring Treg in human peripheral blood and solid tissues. We found that Treg numbers are significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with interleukin 2-treated melanoma and in formalin-fixed tissue from patients with lung and colon carcinomas. Conversely, we show that immunosuppressive therapy including therapeutic antibodies leads to a significant reduction of Treg from the peripheral blood of transplantation patients. In addition, Treg numbers are predictively elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with various solid tumors. Although our data generally correspond to data obtained with gene expression and protein-based methods, the results are less fluctuating and more specific to Treg. The assay presented here measures Treg robustly in blood and solid tissues regardless of conservation levels, promising fast screening of Treg in various clinical settings.

Forty patients were assigned to receive anaesthesia with either intravenous remifentanil (0.3 - 0.6 microg/kg per min; n = 20) or intravenous fentanyl (5 - 10 microg/kg per h; n = 20). Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the expression of SOCS-3 were measured pre- and post-operatively. The data from 33 of the patients were analysed. The IFN-gamma/IL-10 ratio after concanavalin A stimulation in whole blood cells on post-operative day 1 and SOCS-3 gene expression on post-operative day 2 were significantly lower in the remifentanil group than in the fentanyl group. The time in the intensive care unit was also significantly lower in the remifentanil group. These findings suggest that remifentanil can attenuate the exaggerated inflammatory response that occurs after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Further clinical trials are required to define the influence of choice of intra-operative opioid on post-operative outcome.

Point-of-care testing for interleukin-6 in cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) after subarachnoid haemorrhage.	"Intrathecal interleukin (IL)-6 is considered to be a proinflammatory biomarker for cerebral inflammatory response. This is of clinical importance for the prediction of vasospasm after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). We evaluated a bedside technique for the quantitative measurement of IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
32 samples of CSF and serum were taken from 11 patients suffering from SAH on day 3, 4 and 5 after bleeding. A lateral flow immunoassay chip-test (POC-Test) was used for bedside testing and the results were compared to the standard chemiluminescence-based ELISA (Immulite) performed in a specialized laboratory.
For CSF analysis Immulite and POC-Test show linear correlation (r2=0.81). The high IL-6 values found in SAH are depicted more easily by the POC-Test, because it has a working range of up to 10.000 pg/ml instead of up to 1000 pg/ml for Immulite. Serum IL-6 values were clearly lower, suggesting CNS inflammation in SAH.
The new chip-test provides a handy tool for the neurosurgical intensive care unit, analysing CSF IL-6 concentrations within 20 minutes. This is the first time a point-of care test for IL-6 in CSF was evaluated. The test results match the values achieved by the standard Immulite technique. Therefore a tool for clinical routine interleukin-6 investigation is provided which could find use in a broad variety of neurosurgical and neurological diseases."

Comprehensive biomarker monitoring in cytokine therapy: heterogeneous, time-dependent, and persisting immune effects of interleukin-10 application in psoriasis.	Cytokine and anticytokine treatments represent promising approaches for therapy of immune-mediated diseases. In humans, however, regulatory consequences of interference with the cytokine network are only partially understood. Biomarker analysis in clinical studies may help to overcome this complexity and provide novel information about the in vivo relevance of individual cytokines. We report systemic immunological effects of IL-10 therapy in 10 psoriasis patients during a 7-week treatment period followed by a 7-week observation period. IL-10 was given s.c. at 8 microg/kg/day or 20 microg/kg/3 x/week, and a broad range of immunological biomarkers was analyzed in an extended kinetics (17 time-points) before, during, and after IL-10 therapy. Besides the expected anti-inflammatory effects (e.g., inhibition of LPS-induced cytokine secretion), we found unexpected effects, such as activation of NK cells and an increase in parameters indicating proinflammatory activity (C-reactive protein and soluble IL-2R). Furthermore, cumulative effects (IgE and IgA), loss of effect (IL-1R antagonist and IFN-gamma secretion), or counter-regulation during and rebound after IL-10 therapy (TNF-alpha and IL-12/IL-23 p40) were found. Remarkably, some alterations were retained long after the 7-week treatment period (IL-4 secretion, monocytic CD86, and TGF-beta1). In summary, we found manifold effects of IL-10 far beyond the immediate anti-inflammatory activity considered initially. These findings may explain the rather disappointing clinical effects of IL-10 therapy in exacerbated inflammation but also hint to its role for sustained immunological reshaping. They further exemplify the importance of analyzing an extended kinetics of an entire panel of biomarkers for understanding the effects of therapeutic interference with the cytokine network.

Amplifying the fluorescence of bilirubin enables the real-time detection of heme oxygenase activity.	Heme oxygenases (HO) are the rate-limiting enzymes in the degradation of heme to equimolar amounts of antioxidant bile pigments, the signaling molecule carbon monoxide, and ferric iron. The inducible form HO-1 confers protection on cells and tissues that mediates beneficial effects in many diseases. Consequently, measurement of the enzymatic activity is vital in the investigation of the regulatory role of HO. Here we report that the fluorescence characteristics of bilirubin in complex with serum albumin can be used for the real-time detection of HO activity in enzymatic kinetics measurements. We characterized the enzymatic activity of a truncated human HO-1 and measured the HO activity for various cell types and organs, in either the basal naive or the HO-1-induced state. The bilirubin-dependent increase in fluorescence over time monitored by this assay facilitates a very fast, sensitive, and reliable measurement of HO activity. Our approach offers the basis for a highly sensitive high-throughput screening, which provides, inter alia, the opportunity to discover new therapeutic HO-1-inducing agents.

High levels of CMV-IE-1-specific memory T cells are associated with less alloimmunity and improved renal allograft function.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with allograft rejection in solid organ transplantation. However, the immunologic mechanisms behind this observation have not been elucidated. One proposed mechanism is direct cross-reactivity of antiviral T-cells with allogeneic MHC/peptide complexes, a process termed heterologous immunity. Another model favours indirect stimulation of alloimmunity by CMV-induced proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of MHC class II and adhesion molecules. Recently, we found that protection from CMV disease was correlated with high levels of CMV-immediate early-1 (IE-1) specific IFN-gamma-producing T-cell responses in heart and lung transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to define the relation of CMV-specific T-cell responses to acute rejection, donor-reactive memory T cells, and allograft function after kidney transplantation.
To address this issue, IFN-gamma-producing T-cell responses following ex-vivo stimulation with pools of overlapping peptides representing the CMV pp65 and IE-1 proteins, as well as donor-reactive IFN-gamma-producing T-cells were determined at multiple time points before (pre-Tx) and during the first 6 months posttransplant (post-Tx) in 36 kidney transplant recipients using an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent spot assay (ELISPOT).
CMV-specific T cells were not exclusively detectable in CMV seropositive patients, as 3/12 seronegative patients had significant pre- and post-Tx pp65/IE-1-specific T-cell responses. In patients with detectable anti-CMV antibody or T-cell responses, no difference in CMV-specific T-cell frequencies was found between patients with versus without acute rejection. However, early (week 1, r=0.457, p=0.037) and average IE-1-specific T-cell responses (r=-0.415, p=0.032) during 6 months post-Tx showed a significant inverse correlation with average post-Tx donor-reactive T-cell responses. Furthermore, average post-Tx IE-1-specific T-cell responses correlated significantly with 6 and 12 months glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In contrast, pp65-specific T-cell responses did not correlate with donor-reactive T cells or graft function. Only 2/36 patients developed CMV disease, both showing very weak IE-1-specific T-cell responses during the whole monitoring period.
No evidence for heterologous immunity could be found in patients with high levels of CMV-specific T cells. On the contrary, less alloreactivity and improved graft function were found in patients with strong IE-1-specific T-cell responses. These results emphasize the importance of immediate early antigens (IE) as targets for T-cell immunity to CMV. We hypothesize that IE-1-specific T cells might effectively suppress IE-1-induced indirect effects such as inflammation and upregulation of MHC class II and adhesion molecules."

Stability of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 in blood samples of patients with systemic immune activation.	"Tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 serum/plasma levels are frequently used for the monitoring of patients with systemic immune activation/ sepsis. This requires comparability of test results over time. However, cytokines are usually not considered to be very stable after blood collection, which might artificially interfere with test results.
To obtain better knowledge about stability of these cytokines in blood samples for interpretation of test results.
Blood of patients with systemic immune activation was collected in EDTA, lithium heparin, ammonium heparin, and serum tubes. Aliquots were analyzed after storage at room temperature for 2 to 8 hours. Additionally, storage conditions for separated serum/plasma for 24 hours and the reproducibility of repeated cytokine measurements by an automated DPC Immulite analyzer were tested.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha level was stable in EDTA plasma for 8 hours, while slightly increasing in heparin plasma and serum. Interleukin 6 concentrations were stable for 8 hours in all blood types, whereas interleukin 8 concentrations were stable only in EDTA plasma and were strongly increasing in heparin plasma and serum. Cytokine concentrations in separated serum/plasma were stable during 24 hours if stored at 4 degrees C or frozen at -20 or -70 degrees C. Reproducibility of repeated cytokine measurements revealed no significant differences for all blood types.
Cytokine levels were most critically influenced by the period between blood collection and plasma separation, but its impact was strongly dependent on cytokine and anticoagulant. However, under appropriate conditions cytokine levels were surprisingly stable for up to 8 hours."

[Immune monitoring in SIRS and sepsis based on the PIRO model].	Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by a complex interaction between pathogens and the immune system. The analysis of immune parameters in patients with sepsis or at risk for sepsis may help to identify predisposing factors and infection-specific reaction patterns, as well as to monitor the current functional state of the immune system. This may lead to personalized therapeutic strategies for improving outcome in sepsis. Based on the PIRO model (predisposition, insult, response, organ dysfunction), a pathophysiologically-oriented concept for the development of a new sepsis classification, this article reviews currently used and new parameters for immunomonitoring in SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) and sepsis.

Donor brain death significantly interferes with tolerance induction protocols.	Studies in rodents showed that antibodies are able to induce tolerance of allografts. As clinical results are unsatisfactory and deceased donors are still the main source of organ transplants, we investigated whether donor brain-death impacts on tolerance induction after experimental kidney transplantation. Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (RIB 5/2; 2.5 mg/kg x 5 days) treated and untreated recipients of brain-dead donor grafts were compared with RIB 5/2 treated and untreated recipients of living donor grafts (F344-to-Lewis). All recipients received low-dose CsA (1.5 mg/kg x 10 days). Kidneys were recovered 4, 16 and 40 weeks after transplantation and examined by morphology, immunohistology and flow cytometry. Renal function was monitored monthly. RIB 5/2 treatment significantly decreased proteinuria in recipients of living donor allografts when compared with living donor controls. After 40 weeks, inflammatory cell infiltration and MHC class II expression were reduced while morphologic alterations were minimal. In contrast, treatment of brain-dead graft recipients had no impact on graft function. Structural changes and graft infiltration were comparable to brain-dead donor controls at all time points. RIB 5/2 treatment significantly improved graft function in recipients of living donor grafts; however, it was not effective in recipients of brain-dead donor organs.

Clonotype analysis of cytomegalovirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) control the replication of human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Previous studies assessed the clonotypic composition of CTL specific for individual immunodominant peptides within a certain HLA context. Such an approach has inherent limitations and may not assess the true clonal CTL response in vivo. Here, the clonotypic composition of CMV-specific CTL was determined in HLA-A2, CMV-seropositive kidney transplant recipients and healthy blood donors after stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with either a pp65 whole-peptide pool or a single immunodominant peptide. Even after stimulation with the whole peptide pool, CMV-specific CTL remained monoclonal or oligoclonal. Regarding intraindividual variation, the CDR3 motifs of the dominant clones were identical to those observed in CTL generated by the single immunodominant peptide. Sequencing of the CDR3 regions demonstrated significant interindividual variation; however, structural homology was observed for immunodominant clonotypes in three individuals. In conclusion, the highly focused T cell receptor repertoire found after stimulation with either a single immunodominant peptide or a peptide pool demonstrates a pivotal role for immunodominant epitopes in the generation of a clonal repertoire. These results provide new insights into the regulation of CMV clonal dominance and may contribute to the design and monitoring of adoptive immunotherapy.

Stroke-induced immunodepression and post-stroke infections: lessons from the preventive antibacterial therapy in stroke trial.	"Infections are a leading cause of death in patients with acute CNS injury such as stroke. Recent experimental evidence indicated that stroke leads to suppression of innate and adaptive peripheral immune responses which predisposes to infection. However, less is known on phenotypic and functional immune alterations in correlation with the occurrence of infectious complications in patients with acute stroke.
In the recently completed randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Preventive Antibacterial Therapy in Stroke (PANTHERIS) trial on the efficacy of short-term antibacterial therapy to prevent the development of post-stroke infections, we assessed longitudinal changes in lymphocyte subpopulations and mitogen-induced lymphocytic interferon gamma (IFN)-gamma production using flow cytometry in 80 patients with acute severe stroke at days 1, 3, 8, 90 and 180 after clinical onset. Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 concentration as well as urinary levels of norepinephrine and cortisol was assessed within the first 8 days after stroke. Patients of the placebo and verum (moxifloxacin) treatment groups who did or did not develop infections within 11 days after stroke were compared to identify immunological changes associated with the occurrence of post-stroke infections.
Rapid T-lymphopenia and long-lasting suppression of lymphocytic IFN-gamma production were observed in all stroke patients. Patients of the placebo group who developed infections showed a trend toward greater decline of CD4+ Th cell counts and higher urinary levels of norepinephrine early after stroke than patients without infections. Onset of infections was accompanied with higher plasma IL-6 levels in the placebo group but not in the moxifloxacin group. In addition, an early rise in plasma IL-10 was detected in patients who developed infections despite preventive antibacterial treatment.
A rapid loss and functional deactivation of T cells are common changes in stroke patients consistent with immunodepression after brain ischemia. A stronger decrease in cellular immune responses and an increased sympathetic activity after stroke are associated with a higher risk of infections. Increased plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 early after stroke may identify patients who will not respond to preventive antibacterial therapy with moxifloxacin."

Long-term results of subtotal vs total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation in kidney transplant recipients.	"Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation in kidney transplant recipients leads to reduced recurrence rates and similar improvement of clinical symptoms compared with subtotal parathyroidectomy.
A retrospective cohort study.
University clinic.
Thirty-three patients with functioning renal grafts who underwent primary total (n = 17; group 1) or subtotal (n = 16; group 2) parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism.
Long-term levels of intact parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and vitamin D; bone pain; use of medication; and incidence of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism.
The mean length of follow-up was 31 months in group 1 and 41 months in group 2. In all patients, postoperative serum calcium and phosphate levels normalized and bone pain markedly decreased. Persistent hypocalcemia was not observed. Serum creatinine levels intermittently increased in both groups but returned to preoperative levels in most of the patients. In group 1, all patients had undetectable intact parathyroid hormone levels throughout the study period. In group 2, 2 patients had persistent and 3 patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism (31%) that required therapy with cinacalcet hydrochloride in 3 cases. In 4 of these 5 patients, intact parathyroid hormone levels were greater than 54 ng/L directly after operation. In all, 27 of 33 patients (82%) received cholecalciferol therapy. Additional calcium supplementation was used by 12 group 1 patients (71%) and 3 group 2 patients (19%).

Dissection of the CMV specific T-cell response is required for optimized cardiac transplant monitoring.	Despite the success of antivirals in preventing clinically overt CMV disease in cardiac allograft recipients, sub-clinical active CMV infection remains a major concern because of its association with allograft rejection and vasculopathy. The measurement of CMV specific T-cell responses is a promising approach to assessing this situation. For simplicity, class-I MHC/peptide-multimers staining CD8 T-cells directly are often used but this ignores a much wider range of responses including the whole CD4 T-cell compartment. CD4 T-cells, however, were recently shown to be critical to reducing CMV load early after transplantation. To determine how extensive T-cell responses to CMV are, the responses to two dominant CMV proteins, IE-1 and pp65, were dissected in detail accounting for T-cell lineage, frequencies, epitope recognition and changes over time in more than 25 heart transplant recipients. Cross-sectional results from over 30 healthy CMV-carriers were analyzed for comparison. Responses were unexpectedly complex, with considerable inter-individual variation in terms of dominance, breadth, and recognized epitopes. Whereas the use of MHC/peptide-multimers for clinical CD8 T-cell response monitoring alone can be justified in some situations, short term T-cell activation combined with intracellular cytokine staining was clearly found to be of more general usefulness. The performance of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, or IL-2 as single read-outs in identifying activated T-cells was examined and confirmed that the frequently used IFN-gamma was best suited. These results should be used to inform the design of clinically applicable and diagnostically useful approaches to monitoring CMV specific responses in heart transplant recipients.

Mechanisms behind flare of renal lupus during murine pregnancy.	The outcome of pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus is still controversial. The authors recently reported the disappearance of the manifestation of the skin disease but a diminished survival rate in lupus-prone animals undergoing several pregnancies. It was postulated that lupus-prone animals must have subclinical renal symptoms at an early age and that immune and hormonal changes during pregnancy exacerbate immune reactions in the kidneys, leading to a shortened life span. Here, the authors analysed changes at day 14 of pregnancy in lupus-prone LPR (MRL/lpr) mice and MRL controls regarding cytokines, regulatory T (Treg) cells and deposition of immunocomplexes. Worsened kidney function was observed during pregnancy, even in the absence of lupus signs. This was accompanied by renal inflammation and higher interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 levels. C3 and immunoglobulin G deposition was enhanced in kidney and placenta from lupus-prone pregnant animals. Pregnancy enhanced the levels of Treg cells in control animals but not in lupus-prone animals. As pregnancy-induced Treg cells were shown to be specific for paternal antigens it is not to be expected that these Treg cells can help to destroy autoreactive cells. The authors conclude that early subclinical kidney disease in lupus-prone animals exacerbates during pregnancy. Albeit obtained with an experimental animal model, their data are potentially of importance for lupus patients of reproductive age.

[Study protocol of the VISEP study. Response of the SepNet study group].	"In the commentary by Zander et al. the authors appear concerned about the methods and results of our, at that time, unpublished sepsis trial evaluating hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and insulin therapy. Unfortunately, the authors' concerns are based on false assumptions about the design, conduct and modes of action of the compounds under investigation. For instance, in our study the HES solution was not used for maintenance of daily fluid requirements, so that the assumption of the authors that this colloid was used ""exclusively"" is wrong. Moreover, the manufacturer of Hemohes, the HES product we used, gives no cut-off value for creatinine, thus the assumption that this cut-off value was ""doubled"" in our study is also incorrect. Other claims by the authors such as that lactated solutions cause elevated lactate levels, iatrogenic hyperglycemia and increase O(2) consumption are unfounded. There is no randomized controlled trial supporting such a claim - this claim is neither consistent with our study data nor with any credible published sepsis guidelines or with routine practice worldwide. We fully support open scientific debate. Our study methods and results have now been published after a strict peer-reviewing process and this data is now open to critical and constructive reviewing. However, in our opinion this premature action based on wrong assumptions and containing comments by representatives of pharmaceutical companies does not contribute to a serious, unbiased scientific discourse."

NS1 specific CD8+ T-cells with effector function and TRBV11 dominance in a patient with parvovirus B19 associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy.	"Parvovirus B19 (B19V) is the most commonly detected virus in endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) from patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy (DCMi). Despite the importance of T-cells in antiviral defense, little is known about the role of B19V specific T-cells in this entity.
An exceptionally high B19V viral load in EMBs (115,091 viral copies/mug nucleic acids), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum was measured in a DCMi patient at initial presentation, suggesting B19V viremia. The B19V viral load in EMBs had decreased substantially 6 and 12 months afterwards, and was not traceable in PBMCs and the serum at these times. Using pools of overlapping peptides spanning the whole B19V proteome, strong CD8(+) T-cell responses were elicited to the 10-amino-acid peptides SALKLAIYKA (19.7% of all CD8(+) cells) and QSALKLAIYK (10%) and additional weaker responses to GLCPHCINVG (0.71%) and LLHTDFEQVM (0.06%). Real-time RT-PCR of IFNgamma secretion-assay-enriched T-cells responding to the peptides, SALKLAIYKA and GLCPHCINVG, revealed a disproportionately high T-cell receptor Vbeta (TRBV) 11 expression in this population. Furthermore, dominant expression of type-1 (IFNgamma, IL2, IL27 and T-bet) and of cytotoxic T-cell markers (Perforin and Granzyme B) was found, whereas gene expression indicating type-2 (IL4, GATA3) and regulatory T-cells (FoxP3) was low.
Our results indicate that B19V Ag-specific CD8(+) T-cells with effector function are involved in B19V associated DCMi. In particular, a dominant role of TRBV11 and type-1/CTL effector cells in the T-cell mediated antiviral immune response is suggested.

Inhibition of dendritic cell maturation and function is independent of heme oxygenase 1 but requires the activation of STAT3.	The induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) by a single treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPPIX) protects against inflammatory liver failure and ischemia reperfusion injury after allotransplantation. In this context, the HO-1-mediated inhibition of donor-derived dendritic cell maturation and migration is discussed as one of the key events of graft protection. To investigate the poorly understood mechanism of CoPPIX-induced HO-1 activity in more detail, we performed gene expression analysis in murine liver, revealing the up-regulation of STAT3 after CoPPIX treatment. By using wild-type and HO-1-deficient dendritic cells we demonstrated that LPS-induced maturation is dependent on STAT3 phosphorylation and independent of HO-1 activity. In summary, our observations revise our understanding of the anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 and highlight the immunomodulatory capacity of STAT3, which might be of further interest for targeting undesired immune responses, including ischemia reperfusion injury.

Diagnosis and treatment of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder in pediatric heart transplant patients.	PTLD is a severe complication in transplant recipients. Detection of increased EBV load in the peripheral blood acts as a surrogate marker for increased risk of PTLD development. We analyzed the time course of the disease, its severity, the organs involved, and mortality rates in our institutional experience of pediatric heart transplantation. This paper identifies risk factors for PTLD and describes the different ways of diagnosing and treating the disease. PTLD was screened for in 146 pediatric heart transplant patients using a retrospective analysis in patients who received transplantation before 1998. Prospective determination was performed in 72/146 patients transplanted after 1998 within the post-transplant follow-up. The occurrence of PTLD with all interventions, including tapering of immunosuppression, surgery, viral monitoring, and antiviral interventions, was recorded. PTLD was diagnosed in 12/147 (8.2%) children at a mean age of 7.2 +/- 3.3 yr after a mean post-transplant period of 3.2 +/- 2.2 yr. PTLD manifested in: lymph nodes (n = 4), intestine (n = 3), tonsils and adenoids (n = 2), eye (n = 2), and lung (n = 1). It was diagnosed in 7/12 as a monomorphic B-cell lymphoma and in four patients as a monomorphic Burkitt lymphoma, a polymorphic B-cell lymphoma, a T-cell rich or angiocentric lymphoma (Liebow) and as reactive plasmacytic hyperplasia (early lesion), respectively. Histology was not possible in one patient with ocular manifestation. EBV association was 83%. Risk factors in the comparison with patients without PTLD were age at time of Tx, primary EBV infection after Tx, use of Azathioprine and >or=3 doses of ATG. CMV mismatch and CMV infection, rejection episodes and steroids were not risk factors. Despite reduction of immunosuppression, treatment consisted of surgical procedures to remove tumor masses (n = 6), Rituximab (n = 5), polychemotherapy (n = 3), antiviral (n = 1) and autologous T-cell therapy (n = 1). All patients demonstrated full remission without death related to PTLD or treatment at 3.9 (1.3-6.2) yr median follow-up time. The manifestation of PTLD in pediatric heart transplant recipients is associated with EBV infection and is predominantly in the form of a B-cell lymphoma. A tight and specific follow-up including early assessment of immunity status and specific therapeutic intervention to improve cellular immunity is warranted and may contribute to a significant reduction of PTLD-related morbidity and mortality.

Preventive antibacterial therapy in acute ischemic stroke: a randomized controlled trial.	"Pneumonia is a major risk factor of death after acute stroke. In a mouse model, preventive antibacterial therapy with moxifloxacin not only prevents the development of post-stroke infections, it also reduces mortality, and improves neurological outcome significantly. In this study we investigate whether this approach is effective in stroke patients.
Preventive ANtibacterial THERapy in acute Ischemic Stroke (PANTHERIS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 80 patients with severe, non-lacunar, ischemic stroke (NIHSS>11) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. Patients received either intravenous moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) or placebo for 5 days starting within 36 hours after stroke onset. Primary endpoint was infection within 11 days. Secondary endpoints included neurological outcome, survival, development of stroke-induced immunodepression, and induction of bacterial resistance.
On intention-to treat analysis (79 patients), the infection rate at day 11 in the moxifloxacin treated group was 15.4% compared to 32.5% in the placebo treated group (p = 0.114). On per protocol analysis (n = 66), moxifloxacin significantly reduced infection rate from 41.9% to 17.1% (p = 0.032). Stroke associated infections were associated with a lower survival rate. In this study, neurological outcome and survival were not significantly influenced by treatment with moxifloxacin. Frequency of fluoroquinolone resistance in both treatment groups did not differ. On logistic regression analysis, treatment arm as well as the interaction between treatment arm and monocytic HLA-DR expression (a marker for immunodepression) at day 1 after stroke onset was independently and highly predictive for post-stroke infections.
PANTHERIS suggests that preventive administration of moxifloxacin is superior in reducing infections after severe non-lacunar ischemic stroke compared to placebo. In addition, the results emphasize the pivotal role of immunodepression in developing post-stroke infections.

Sepsis: time has come to focus on the later stages.	"Despite numerous advances in intensive care medicine, sepsis remains a deadly disease. Today, conventional therapeutic approaches and mainstream scientific research mostly focus on symptomatic early goal directed organ support therapy. This includes fluid resuscitation, choice and timing of antibiotics and vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement strategies. Furthermore, great effort has been undertaken to investigate whether tightly controlled blood glucose levels, the application of corticosteroids, and early medication using activated protein C improves survival. However, most of these mainstream approaches have recently been shown unsuccessful in large-scale clinical trials. Current data now suggest that besides giving fluids, antibiotics, and symptomatic organ support, little - if at all - can be done to improve mortality from sepsis. This might be due to the fact that in the presence of modern intensive care medicine, most patients with severe sepsis or septic shock will survive the early ""shock phase"" of the disease. Mounting evidence suggests that in the course of the disease, most septic patients are then subjected to a secondary phase, which is characterised by a failure of cell-mediated immunity. This leads to repeated and uncontrolled infections, ""chronic"" multiple organ failure, and death in a large number of cases. Here we hypotheses that in order to profoundly influence survival from sepsis, future therapeutic efforts in the field should concentrate on this later ""hypo-immune"" stage of sepsis, associated immune phenomena, and novel immunomodulatory strategies. This may lead to the development of advanced immunomodulatory therapies available for widespread clinical use. Today, in the era of antibiotics and advanced organ system support therapy, it is not the bug that kills you- survival has become a matter of whether your cellular immune system can cope."

Dextran sulfate facilitates anti-CD4 mAb-induced long-term rat cardiac allograft survival after prolonged cold ischemia.	Ischemia/reperfusion injury leads to activation of graft endothelial cells (EC), boosting antigraft immunity and impeding tolerance induction. We hypothesized that the complement inhibitor and EC-protectant dextran sulfate (DXS, MW 5000) facilitates long-term graft survival induced by non-depleting anti-CD4 mAb (RIB 5/2). Hearts from DA donor rats were heterotopically transplanted into Lewis recipients treated with RIB 5/2 (20 mg/kg, days-1,0,1,2,3; i.p.) with or without DXS (grafts perfused with 25 mg, recipients treated i.v. with 25 mg/kg on days 1,3 and 12.5 mg/kg on days 5,7,9,11,13,15). Cold graft ischemia time was 20 min or 12 h. Median survival time (MST) was comparable between RIB 5/2 and RIB 5/2+DXS-treated recipients in the 20-min group with >175-day graft survival. In the 12-h group RIB 5/2 only led to chronic rejection (MST = 49.5 days) with elevated alloantibody response, whereas RIB 5/2+DXS induced long-term survival (MST >100 days, p < 0.05) with upregulation of genes related to transplantation tolerance. Analysis of the 12-h group treated with RIB 5/2+DXS at 1-day posttransplantation revealed reduced EC activation, complement deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration. In summary, DXS attenuates I/R-induced acute graft injury and facilitates long-term survival in this clinically relevant transplant model.

T cell response to the cytomegalovirus major capsid protein (UL86) is dominated by helper cells with a large polyfunctional component and diverse epitope recognition.	T cells are crucial in controlling cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The CMV major capsid protein (UL86) is frequently recognized by these cells, but the nature of this response has not been explored in detail. In this study, healthy CMV-exposed individuals were examined, and ex vivo peptide stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and flow-cytometry were used to obtain data, including response prevalence, magnitude, functional profiles, and recognized epitopes. Of 24 subjects, 19 (79%) had a UL86-specific CD4 T cell response rate between 0.03% and 1.4%. This group of individuals exhibited a similar percentage of polyfunctional T cells in their UL86-specific and pp65-specific responses. A total of 8 CD4 T cell epitopes were identified. In contrast, CD8 T cell responses to UL86 were rare and small. UL86 is of interest for monitoring the response to CMV.

Impact of cell culture media on the expansion efficiency and T-cell receptor Vbeta (TRBV) repertoire of in vitro expanded T cells using feeder cells.	"The effects of different cell culture media on expansion efficiency and alterations in T-cell receptor V beta (TRBV) expression of in vitro expanded lymphocytes are not well established.
Low numbers of CD3+ T cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy donors were subjected to polyclonal in vitro expansion in the presence of autologous CD3-depleted mononuclear cells as feeder cells (FCs) and their numbers and TRBV expressions were compared in media containing human (HS-RPMI) or fetal bovine serum (FBS-RPMI), Panserin413, or X-Vivo 15TM designed for lymphocyte culture.
During three courses of restimulation within 28 days with CD3-antibody (OKT-3), IL-2, and initial CD3+, T-cell: FC ratios of 1:50 lowered to 1:5 and T cells expanded more than 1,000-fold in the media containing complete sera. Loss of cluster formation, associated with expansion failure, was only observed in cultures using synthetic media and resulted in only about 70-fold expansion. Whereas TRVB expression as determined by real-time PCR was substantially altered after 14 days of culture in X-Vivo 15, at day 28 only T cells from long-term culture in HS-RPMI presented the initial TRBV composition.
Culture media have substantial impact on in vitro T-cell expansion. In the presence of FCs, medium containing human serum is superior to synthetic media and FBS-RPMI for long-term culture regarding T-cell number and TRBV repertoire. In contrast, the synthetic media Panserin413 and XVivo15 show lower expansion efficiency and reproducibility and, as RPMI1640+10%FBS, can contribute to overstimulation of certain TRBVs at advanced culture time points."

A simple assay to measure phagocytosis of live bacteria.	"The phagocytosis of pathogens is essential for fighting infections. No assay is available, however, to measure both engulfment and degradation of bacteria under conditions similar to those in vivo. We sought to develop a flow cytometric assay to measure the engulfment and degradation of live bacteria by human blood monocytes and granulocytes.
We generated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing Eschericha coli by transforming E. coli with the plasmid vector pEGFP. We used these bacteria in a flow cytometric assay to measure both engulfment and degradation of living bacteria by monocytes and granulocytes in human whole blood from fresh, heparinized venous blood samples. To determine whether the test detected differences between healthy individuals and patients with secondary immunodeficiencies, we compared the phagocytosis of monocytes and granulocytes measured in blood samples from immunosuppressed kidney transplantation patients and from patients with postoperative sepsis in immunoparalysis with phagocytosis measured in samples from age-matched healthy individuals.
In samples from healthy individuals, we found that in both monocytes and granulocytes bacterial degradation was negatively correlated with the age of the sample donor. Furthermore, we detected decreased bacterial engulfment in granulocytes from septic patients and decreased bacterial degradation in monocytes from immunosuppressed kidney transplantation patients.
This flow cytometric assay measures the engulfment and degradation of live bacteria by human blood monocytes and granulocytes. By means of this assay we detected significant differences between healthy controls and patients with secondary immunodeficiencies that may contribute to the increased incidence of infection complications seen in these patients."

Circulating alloreactive T cells correlate with graft function in longstanding renal transplant recipients.	Monitoring for alloreactive memory T cells after organ transplantation may allow individualization of immunosuppression. Two pathways of T cell allorecognition have been implicated in chronic graft dysfunction: Direct (recipient T cells respond to donor peptides presented by donor antigen-presenting cells) and indirect (donor peptides are processed and presented by recipient antigen-presenting cells). Previous studies have assessed these alloresponses only during the first 2 yr after kidney transplantation,so this study correlated the presence of circulating donor-reactive memory/effector T cells, primed by both pathways, in 34 longstanding living-donor renal transplant recipients using the highly sensitive IFN-gamma Elispot assay. Remarkably, 59% of patients had directly primed donor-reactive T cells, and their presence correlated directly with serum creatinine (P = 0.001) and inversely with estimated GFR (P = 0.042). Multivariate analysis revealed that hyporesponsiveness of direct, donor-specific T cells was the only variable that significantly correlated with graft function and that antidonor indirect alloreactivity was the only variable that significantly correlated with proteinuria. Interestingly, when both allorecognition pathways were considered together, patients with undetectable direct alloreactivity had better longterm graft function, independent of allosensitization by the indirect pathway. In conclusion, circulating donor-specific alloreactive T cells primed by both pathways are detectable long after transplantation and are associated with graft injury. Assessment of alloreactive memory/effector T cells might be helpful to tailor individual immunosuppression regimens for transplant recipients in the future.

Evidence for the pivotal role of endogenous toll-like receptor 4 ligands in liver ischemia and reperfusion injury.	"Although toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation has been demonstrated to play a key role in the induction of intrahepatic inflammation, leading to hepatocellular damage in liver ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), the nature of TLR4 ligands generated during tissue injury remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that endogenous TLR4 ligands, rather than endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), are instrumental in the activation of liver TLR4 leading to local inflammation response that culminates in ultimate organ IRI.
By using the LPS-neutralizing agent, recombinant bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, we showed that the endotoxin blockade failed to protect mouse livers from warm IRI, as assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase levels, intrahepatic inflammatory gene induction profile, and liver pathology. The recombinant bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein did not cause any hepatocytoxicity by itself if injected into normal naive mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liver perfusates, generated by isolated liver perfusion system, contained LPS-independent, heat-sensitive protein molecules that activated macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha through TLR4 but not TLR2 pathway.
This study provides a definitive evidence that endogenous TLR4 ligands are critical in the pathogenesis of liver IRI."

Oral high-dose atorvastatin treatment in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.	"Recent data from animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) and from a pilot study indicated a possible beneficial impact of statins on MS.
Safety, tolerability and effects on disease activity of atorvastatin given alone or in combination with interferon-beta (IFN-beta) were assessed in a phase II open-label baseline-to-treatment trial in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Patients with at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion (CEL) at screening by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were eligible for the study. After a baseline period of 3 monthly MRI scans (months -2 to 0), patients followed a 9-month treatment period on 80 mg atorvastatin daily. The number of CEL in treatment months 6 to 9 compared to baseline served as the primary endpoint. Other MRI-based parameters as well as changes in clinical scores and immune responses served as secondary endpoints. Of 80 RRMS patients screened, 41 were included, among them 16 with IFN-beta comedication. The high dose of 80 mg atorvastatin was well tolerated in the majority of patients, regardless of IFN-beta comedication. Atorvastatin treatment led to a substantial reduction in the number and volume of CEL in two-sided multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008). A trend towards a significant decrease in number and volume of CEL was also detected in patients with IFN-beta comedication (p = 0.060 and p = 0.062), in contrast to patients without IFN-beta comedication (p = 0.170 and p = 0.140). Immunological investigations showed no suppression in T cell response but a significant increase in IL-10 production.
Our data suggest that high-dose atorvastatin treatment in RRMS is safe and well tolerated. Moreover, MRI analysis indicates a possible beneficial effect of atorvastatin, alone or in combination with IFN-beta, on the development of new CEL. Thus, our findings provide a rationale for phase II/III trials, including combination of atorvastatin with already approved immunomodulatory therapy regimens.

Interleukin-6 serum level assessment using a new qualitative point-of-care test in sepsis: A comparison with ELISA measurements.	"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is involved in inflammatory diseases, provides prognostical information, and allows the early identification and monitoring of septic patients. We investigated whether IL-6 can be assessed using a new densitometric point-of-care (POC) bedside assay.
392 samples were prospectively collected from 57 intensive care unit patients (38 male, age: 45.2 +/- 16.9years, APACHE II score: 25.4 +/- 4.8). Blinded IL-6 measurements were performed using conventional semiautomatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and the POC test.
Mean IL-6 levels were 102.9 +/- 388.6pg/mL (ELISA) and 97.0 +/- 535.5 (POC). A significant correlation was found (p < 0.0001, r = 0.92). The sensitivity/specificity for sepsis was 82.6%/86.5% (ELISA, AUC: 0.881), and 76.4%/95.0% (POC, AUC: 0.868).
Here we demonstrate significant correlations of IL-6 levels determined using a POC test and semiautomatic ELISA. ROC analyses revealed no significant differences between the two tests. With a turn-around time of 20min, the bedside IL-6 test is a new tool that may help to initiate early goal-directed therapy."

Influence of vaccination and surgery on HLA-DR expression in patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer.	Major surgery is associated with an increased risk of post-operative immunosuppression and infections. We investigated the influence of influenza vaccination on cell-mediated immune responses in cancer patients undergoing either surgical or conservative therapy. Forty patients with an upper aerodigestive tract tumour were allocated to either a surgical or non-surgical treatment course. Patients within each group were randomized to the vaccination or non-vaccination group. Vaccination was performed twice before surgery or conservative treatment. Human leucocyte antigen receptor (HLA-DR) expression on monocytes was analysed by flow cytometry. In the surgical patients, HLA-DR expression on day 1 after surgery decreased in both the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. Vaccinated non-surgical patients showed significantly increased HLA-DR expression levels compared with the non-vaccinated patients. This pilot study demonstrated that vaccination increased monocyte HLA-DR expression in conservatively-treated cancer patients whereas surgery abrogated this response. Vaccination before surgery, therefore, might not help to maintain immune reactivity after surgery.

Effect of immunisation against angiotensin II with CYT006-AngQb on ambulatory blood pressure: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase IIa study.	"Hypertension can be controlled adequately with existing drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Nevertheless, treatment success is often restricted by patients not adhering to treatment. Immunisation against angiotensin II could solve this problem. We investigated the safety and efficacy of CYT006-AngQb-a vaccine based on a virus-like particle-that targets angiotensin II to reduce ambulatory blood pressure.
In this multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase IIa trial, 72 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomly assigned with a computer-generated randomisation list to receive subcutaneous injections of either 100 mug CYT006-AngQb (n=24), 300 mug CYT006-AngQb (24), or placebo (24), at weeks 0, 4, and 12. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was measured before treatment and at week 14. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00500786.
Two patients in the 100 mug group, three in the 300 mug group, and none in the placebo group discontinued study treatment. All patients were included in safety analyses; efficacy analyses did not include the five dropouts, for whom no data were available at week 14. Five serious adverse events were reported (two in the 100 mug group, two in the 300 mug group, and one in the placebo group); none were deemed to be treatment related. Most side-effects were mild, transient reactions at the injection site. Mild, transient influenza-like symptoms were seen in three patients in the 100 mug group, seven in the 300 mug group, and none in the placebo group. In the 300 mug group, there was a reduction from baseline in mean ambulatory daytime blood pressure at week 14 by -9.0/-4.0 mm Hg compared with placebo (p=0.015 for systolic and 0.064 for diastolic). The 300 mug dose reduced the early morning blood-pressure surge compared with placebo (change at 0800 h -25/-13 mm Hg; p<0.0001 for systolic, p=0.0035 for diastolic).
Immunisation with CYT006-AngQb was associated with no serious adverse events; most observed adverse events were consistent with local or systemic responses similar to those seen with other vaccines. The 300 mug dose reduced blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension during the daytime, especially in the early morning.

IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, IL-28, and IL-29 are new members of the IL-10 interferon family. Monocytes are well-known sources of IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. We demonstrated here that monocytes also expressed IL-29, and monocyte differentiation into macrophages (Mphi) or dendritic cells (DCs) strongly changed their production capacity of these cytokines. Maturation of DCs with bacterial stimuli induced high expression of IL-28/IL-29 and IL-20. Simulated T cell interaction and inflammatory cytokines induced IL-29 and IL-20 in maturing DCs, respectively. Compared with monocytes, DCs expressed only minimal IL-19 levels and no IL-24. The differentiation of monocytes into Mphi reduced their IL-19 and terminated their IL-20, IL-24, and IL-29 production capacity. Like monocytes, neither Mphi nor DCs expressed IL-22 or IL-26. The importance of maturing DCs as a source of IL-28/IL-29 was supported by the much higher mRNA levels of these mediators in maturing DCs compared with those in CMV-infected fibroblasts, and the presence of IL-28 in lymph nodes but not in liver of lipopolysaccharide-injected mice. IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26 do not seem to affect Mphi or DCs as deduced from the lack of corresponding receptor chains. The significance of IL-20 and IL-28/IL-29 coexpression in maturing DCs may lie in the broadly amplified innate immunity in neighboring tissue cells like keratinocytes. In fact, IL-20 induced the expression of antimicrobial proteins, whereas IL-28/IL-29 enhanced the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the response to TLR ligands. However, the strongest response to TLR2 and TLR3 activation showed keratinocytes in the simultaneous presence of IL-20 and IL-29.

HLA-DR alpha 2 mediates negative signalling via binding to Tirc7 leading to anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects in lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo.	Classically, HLA-DR expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) initiates lymphocyte activation via presentation of peptides to TCR bearing CD4+ T-Cells. Here we demonstrate that HLA-DR alpha 2 domain (sHLA-DRalpha2) also induces negative signals by engaging TIRC7 on lymphocytes. This interaction inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells via activation of the intrinsic pathway. Proliferation inhibition is associated with SHP-1 recruitment by TIRC7, decreased phosphorylation of STAT4, TCR-zeta chain & ZAP70, and inhibition of IFN-gamma and FasL expression. HLA-DRalpha2 and TIRC7 co-localize at the APC-T cell interaction site. Triggering HLA-DR - TIRC7 pathway demonstrates that sHLA-DRalpha2 treatment inhibits proinflammatory-inflammatory cytokine expression in APC & T cells after lipopolysaccaride (LPS) stimulation in vitro and induces apoptosis in vivo. These results suggest a novel antiproliferative role for HLA-DR mediated via TIRC7, revise the notion of an exclusive stimulatory interaction of HLA-DR with CD4+ T cells and highlights a novel physiologically relevant regulatory pathway.

Preamplification techniques for real-time RT-PCR analyses of endomyocardial biopsies.	"Due to the limited RNA amounts from endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) and low expression levels of certain genes, gene expression analyses by conventional real-time RT-PCR are restrained in EMBs. We applied two preamplification techniques, the TaqMan(R) PreAmp Master Mix (T-PreAmp) and a multiplex preamplification following a sequence specific reverse transcription (SSRT-PreAmp).
T-PreAmp encompassing 92 gene assays with 14 cycles resulted in a mean improvement of 7.24 +/- 0.33 Ct values. The coefficients for inter- (1.89 +/- 0.48%) and intra-assay variation (0.85 +/- 0.45%) were low for all gene assays tested (<4%). The PreAmp uniformity values related to the reference gene CDKN1B for 91 of the investigated gene assays (except for CD56) were -0.38 +/- 0.33, without significant differences between self-designed and ABI inventoried Taqman(R) gene assays. Only two of the tested Taqman(R) ABI inventoried gene assays (HPRT-ABI and CD56) did not maintain PreAmp uniformity levels between -1.5 and +1.5. In comparison, the SSRT-PreAmp tested on 8 self-designed gene assays yielded higher Ct improvement (9.76 +/- 2.45), however was not as robust regarding the maintenance of PreAmp uniformity related to HPRT-CCM (-3.29 +/- 2.40; p < 0.0001), and demonstrated comparable intra-assay CVs (1.47 +/- 0.74), albeit higher inter-assay CVs (5.38 +/- 2.06; p = 0.01). Comparing EMBs from each 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and inflammatory cardiomyopathy (DCMi), T-PreAmp real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed differential regulation regarding 27 (30%) of the investigated 90 genes related to both HPRT-CCM and CDKN1B. Ct values of HPRT and CDKN1B did not differ in equal RNA amounts from explanted DCM and donor hearts.
In comparison to the SSRT-PreAmp, T-PreAmp enables a relatively simple workflow, and results in a robust PreAmp of multiple target genes (at least 92 gene assays as tested here) by a mean Ct improvement around 7 cycles, and in a lower inter-assay variance in RNA derived from EMBs. Preliminary analyses comparing EMBs from DCM and DCMi patients, revealing differential regulation regarding 30% of the investigated genes, confirm that T-PreAmp is a suitable tool to perform gene expression analyses in EMBs, expanding gene expression investigations with the limited RNA/cDNA amounts derived from EMBs. CDKN1B, in addition to its function as a reference gene for the calculation of PreAmp uniformity, might serve as a suitable housekeeping gene for real-time RT-PCR analyses of myocardial tissues."

Relationship of immunosuppression to Epstein-Barr viral load and lymphoproliferative disease in pediatric heart transplant patients.	"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a severe complication in transplant recipients. Detection of increased Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) load in the peripheral blood acts as a surrogate marker for increased risk of PTLD development. We prospectively monitored EBV load, immunosuppression and PTLD in pediatric heart transplant (HTx) patients to determine risk factors for an increased EBV load and risk of PTLD.
Forty-one pediatric heart transplant recipients were included and underwent prospective monitoring of their immunosuppression and ethylene-diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood sampling for EBV load (copies/microg DNA) measurement using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR; TaqMan) during January 2001 to December 2006.
EBV load was measurable in 70% and was significantly increased (>2,000 copies/microg DNA) in 35% of the patients, with a median EBV load of 5,100 (range 0 to 50,665 copies/microg DNA). Increased EBV load was detected in patients receiving CsA-azathioprine or more than two doses of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and in those <10 years of age, without any significant differences in CsA blood levels. Lowest or negative EBV load was measured in patients receiving CsA-mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or CsA only. CsA blood levels were not predictable for increased EBV load or PTLD. Six patients developed a EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma (PTLD), among whom 4 (67%) were receiving CsA-azathioprine.
Frequent EBV load monitoring identifies patients at high risk for PTLD development. Azathioprine and ATG are major risk factors for increased EBV load and PTLD and patients may benefit from a change of immunosuppression in addition to pre-emptive anti-viral or anti-tumor strategies."

Salvage therapy for relapsed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) with a second progression of PTLD after Upfront chemotherapy: the role of single-agent rituximab.	Currently no standard treatment exists for patients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders relapsed or refractory to chemotherapy after failure of reduction in immunosuppression. We have analyzed the effects of single-agent rituximab treatment in eight patients (seven adult, one pediatric) in this setting. Three patients had been salvaged with rituximab several times. In the seven adults, rituximab salvage therapy achieved complete remission (CR) in three patients (43%) and partial remission in one (14%). In the pediatric patient, a PR was obtained that could be reinduced on relapse with repeated administrations of rituximab. Patients achieving CR either remained in CR or were successfully salvaged again with single-agent rituximab. At a median follow-up of 69 months, median progression-free survival was 9 months and no relevant therapy-associated toxicity was observed. Single-agent rituximab salvage therapy is an effective treatment option in this setting of intensively pretreated patients, with virtually no therapy-associated toxicity.

Modulation of graft arteriosclerosis in a rat carotid transplantation model.	"Venous autografts used in cardiovascular surgery tend to deteriorate over time due to arteriosclerotic complications. Cadaveric vascular allografts represent a possible alternative for this application, but donor endothelial cells (ECs) and antigen presenting cells of the graft trigger alloresponses mediated by MHC class I (MHC I) antigen, leading to graft failure. Vascular allograft rejection might be prevented by reducing cell surface expression of MHC I and thereby lowering the immunogenicity of the grafts.
An Intrabody approach was used to reduce MHC I expression in vascular allografts. The efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad) carrying an anti-MHC I Intrabody gene (Ad-Intrabody) was first tested in vitro using rat aortic ECs. The effect of the Ad-Intrabody was then studied in vivo by a model of rat carotid artery transplantation. Grafts were analyzed 7 and 28 days after transplantation by immunohistochemistry and real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Ad-Intrabody gene transfer reduced MHC I surface expression of rat ECs and inhibited in vivo alloimmune responses to carotid allografts. Decreased T cell and macrophage infiltration was observed within Ad-Intrabody transduced arterial allografts at day 28. This was associated with an inhibition of intimal thickening formation. Analysis of mRNA showed diminished levels of T cell markers and Interferon-gamma expression in the Ad-Intrabody-treated group compared with control groups.
Ex vivo adenoviral gene transfer of an Intrabody against MHC I into rat carotid arteries prior to transplantation reduced both graft arteriosclerosis and inflammation in the absence of any systemic immunosuppression."

Supporting the hypothesis of pregnancy as a tumor: survivin is upregulated in normal pregnant mice and participates in human trophoblast proliferation.	"Survivin, a tumor-promoting antiapoptotic molecule, is expressed in the human placenta. Here, we analyzed its expression during normal and pathological murine pregnancy and investigated its participation in human first trimester trophoblast cell survival and proliferation.
We first analyzed the expression of survivin on the mRNA and protein level at the fetal-maternal interface of normal pregnant (CBA/J x BALB/c) and abortion-prone (CBA/J x DBA/2J) mice at different pregnancy stages by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We also evaluated apoptosis in murine trophoblasts in both mating combinations by TUNEL technique. Functional studies were carried out by knockdown survivin by means of siRNA methodology in two human first trimester trophoblast cell lines [Swan.71 (Sw.71) and HTR8 (H8)].
We observed a peak in mRNA levels on day 5 and a peak of protein levels on day 8 of pregnancy in both combinations. The level of survivin in animals from the abortion-prone group was decreased compared with normal pregnant mice on day 8, which was accompanied by elevated apoptosis rates. In later pregnancy stages (days 10 and 14), survivin levels decreased to levels comparable to those observed right after fecundation in both groups. Transfection of human first trimester cell lines (H8 and Sw.71) with siRNA targeting the survivin gene led to a 76-82% reduction of its expression leading to reduced trophoblast cell viability and proliferation.
Our findings suggest an important role of survivin to promote trophoblast cell survival and proliferation during placentation, thus maintaining pregnancy. The pregnancy-associated expression of a cancer molecule such as survivin supports the 'pseudo-malignancy' hypothesis of pregnancy. Our data may contribute to the better understanding of trophoblast cell development during implantation and placentation."

KIR/HLA ligand incompatibility in kidney transplantation.	"The polymorphic family of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) consists of activating and inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and effector T cells that recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands. It has been suggested that KIR/HLA incompatibility exerts beneficial effects in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
To elucidate whether certain receptor-ligand combinations between recipient KIR and donor HLA antigens lead to enhanced alloreactivity of NK cells associated with acute rejection (aRx) after kidney transplantation, we analyzed the entirety of matches/mismatches between KIR genes and known HLA ligands for aRx patients (n=105) compared to patients with stable renal function (n=119).
Whereas HLA-C ligand incompatibility between donor and recipient has no influence on aRx, grafts derived from donors homozygous for HLA-C group 2 alleles seem to demonstrate a better outcome (P=0.052). Additionally, a higher number of inhibitory receptors in the recipient's genotype (P=0.042), a significant higher number of matches for the receptors KIR2DL2/DS2 (P=0.004), as well as a higher number of mismatches for KIR2DL3 (P=0.014) could be observed for patients with stable renal function.
Our data illustrate that certain KIR/HLA class I ligand combinations between donor and recipient might influence graft short-term outcome after renal transplantation."

Phenotypic differences between healthy effector CTL and leukemic LGL cells support the notion of antigen-triggered clonal transformation in T-LGL leukemia.	T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL) is a chronic clonal lymphoproliferation of CTL. In many ways, T-LGL clones resemble terminal effector CTL, including down-modulation of CD28 and overexpression of perforin, granzymes, and CD57. We studied the transcriptome of T-LGL clones and compared it with healthy CD8+CD57+ effector cells as well as CD8+CD57- populations. T-LGL clones were sorted based on their TCR variable beta-chain restriction, and controls were obtained by pooling cell populations from 14 donors. Here, we focus our analysis on immunological networks, as immune mechanisms play a prominent role in the etiology of bone marrow failure in T-LGL. Informative genes identified by expression arrays were studied further in an independent cohort of patients using Taqman PCR, ELISA assays, and FACS analysis. Despite a strikingly similar gene expression profile between T-LGL clones and their healthy counterparts, important phenotypic differences were identified, including up-modulation of TNFRS9, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, IFN-gamma, and IFN-gamma-related genes, and several integrins/adhesion molecules. In addition, T-LGL clones were characterized by an overexpression of chemokines and chemokine receptors that are typically associated with viral infections (CXCL2, Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1, IL-18, CCR2). Our studies suggest that immunodominant LGL clones, although phenotypically similar to effector CTL, show significantly altered expression of a number of genes, including those associated with an ongoing viral infection or chronic, antigen-driven immune response.

Long-term interleukin-10 presence induces the development of a novel, monocyte-derived cell type.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is one of the most crucial immunoregulatory cytokines. Its short-term effects have been analysed extensively, but little is known about its long-term effects. This is of considerable importance, as high systemic IL-10 levels are present for long periods in patients with persistent viral infections, certain cancers and in critical care patients. Our study investigated the effects of the long-term presence of IL-10 on human peripheral blood monocytes. In vitro, IL-10 treatment of these cells for 7 days induced the development of a novel cell type characterized by unique phenotypical and functional characteristics. These cells showed high HLA-DR expression and low expression of CD86 and other co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. The mRNA levels of both HLA-DR and CD86 were high, but no intracellular accumulation of CD86 protein was observed. With respect to its function, these cells showed strongly diminished tumour necrosis factor-alpha production following lipopolysaccharide stimulation, strongly diminished allogenic CD4(+) T cell stimulatory capacity, and even induced a hyporesponsive state in CD4(+) T cells. The phenotype remained stable despite the removal of IL-10. In vivo, we found monocytic cells from patients exhibiting this phenotype after long-term IL-10 exposure. These results complement our knowledge further about the biological effects of IL-10 and may provide an explanation for the sustained immunodeficiency in cases of the persistent presence of systemic IL-10.

Generation of EBV-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy: a novel protocol using formalin-fixed stimulator cells to increase biosafety.	Adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro generated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific T cells is a safe and effective treatment in patients with EBV-related complications after transplantation. More frequent use of EBV-specific T cells is held back by their cost and time-intensive generation under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions. Currently, EBV-specific T cells are produced by repetitive stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), a protocol that requires several open GMP-handling steps. The aim of the present study was to improve T-cell generation under GMP conditions. We introduce a novel generation protocol that replaces repetitive with short-term LCL stimulation of PMBCs. Vital and formalin-fixed LCLs were used to further increase biosafety. Stimulated T cells were selected by the clinically approved cytokine secretion assay followed by nonspecific expansion. Sufficient numbers of EBV-specific T-cell lines were generated with all protocols. Specific recognition and killing of EBV-infected targets was found and was independent of the generation protocol applied. The novel protocol based on formalin-fixed cells, selection, and expansion reduced open GMP-handling steps and increased biosafety. Furthermore, fixation will allow the use of transgenic LCLs (eg, with cytomegalovirus or tumor antigens) and thereby facilitate the generation of antigen-specific T cells directed against pathogens other than EBV.

Cellular immunodepression preceding infectious complications after acute ischemic stroke in humans.	"We have recently shown that ischemic stroke causes a stress-mediator-induced long-lasting immunodepressive state in mice.
Using head magnetic resonance imaging and standardized immunoassays, we prospectively investigated whether poststroke immunodepression is also seen in humans.

Immunodepression was more pronounced in patients with severe clinical deficit or large infarction. On admission the combination of monocytic tumor necrosis factor alpha release ex vivo and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score were the best predictors for nosocomial infection, preferentially affecting older SP.

Effects of interleukin-12p40 gene transfer on rat corneal allograft survival.	"Despite the immunologically privileged nature of the cornea, graft rejection remains the major cause of human corneal allograft failure. Gene therapy is an interesting approach to introduce immunoregulatory molecules into the graft or the recipient to prevent rejection. In this study we investigated the immmunomodulatory effects of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of a Th1 antagonist, interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), in vitro and on allogeneic graft survival in a rat experimental keratoplasty model.
Donor corneas were transduced with an E1/E3 deleted adenoviral (Ad) vector encoding the IL-12p40 gene (AdIL-12p40) and assayed for the expression of the therapeutic gene. Cell culture supernatants containing IL-12p40 protein were generated by transducing human corneal endothelial cells with AdIL-12p40 and analysed for their capacity to inhibit production of IFN-gamma by naive T cells. The effect of both local (ex vivo Ad-mediated gene transfer) and systemic (i.p.-injection) over-expression of IL-12p40 was investigated by analysing the survival of corneal allografts transplanted from Wistar-Furth rats to fully MHC-class I/II incompatible Lewis rats. Moreover, the intra-graft mRNA-expression profile of cytokines and T cell markers was investigated at different time points after gene transfer.
Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in cultured corneas led to significant IL-12p40 protein expression as determined by specific ELISA. Moreover we could show that IL-12p40 protein containing supernatants significantly inhibited the production of IFN-gamma by alloreactive naive T cells. Interestingly, neither ex vivo genetic modification of cultured corneas before transplantation nor systemic AdIL-12p40 treatment of recipients receiving allogeneic corneas did improve corneal allograft survival. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of ex vivo modified cornea allografts on day 7 after transplantation showed significantly higher IL-4 mRNA-expression levels in the AdIL-12p40 group compared to the control group. Other significant differences in mRNA-expression levels of intra-graft CD3, CD25, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 could not be detected, neither on day 7 nor on the day of rejection.
Despite the capacity of IL-12p40 protein to inhibit the production of IFN-gamma of naive T cells in vitro and some Th1/Th2 shift in vivo, no prolongation of allogeneic graft survival of both AdIL-12p40 modified rat corneas and systemically treated rats could be obtained after transplantation. The possible binding of Ad-mediated IL-12p40 with ubiquitously expressed IL-12p35 in vivo might therefore limit the application of IL-12p40 for the prevention of transplant rejection."

Kinetics of regulatory T cells during murine pregnancy.	"The semi-allogeneic fetus is usually tolerated by the maternal immune system. This was proposed to be modulated by CD4+CD25+foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). We aimed to determine the kinetics of Treg during murine gestation and investigate whether changes in Treg levels respond to hormonal variations during pregnancy or generated changes in the local indolamine dioxygenase (IDO) expression.
We included in our studies the well-known CBA/JxDBA/2J abortion-prone combination using CBA/JxBALB/c as controls. CBA/JxC57/BL6 and BALB/cxC57/BL6 were included as further controls. Animals were killed on days 0, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of pregnancy to measure the levels of Treg, pregnancy-related hormones and IDO expression.
A Treg augmentation in normal pregnancy combinations could be observed on day 2 in several organs contrary to the observations made in abortion-prone mice. No differences in hormonal levels could be seen among all groups. IDO was expressed exclusively in placenta starting from day eight, showing no variations among the groups.
Differences in Treg levels and pregnancy outcome do not correlate with changes in hormonal levels. In addition, as Treg augmentation takes place early and it is observed mainly in the decidual component of the fetal-maternal interface, IDO does not seem to be the pathway underlying Treg protective activity as proposed for humans."

Antigen specificity was studied in experiments in which animals were vaccinated with paternal antigens or adoptively transferred with regulatory T cells. To analyze regulatory T cell-mediated mechanisms, we used neutralizing antibodies against IL-10 or TGF-beta.
Regulatory T cells are activated by male antigens, and minor antigens are protected by linked immunosuppression. Our data exclude the possibility that regulatory T cell expansion during pregnancy is exclusively driven by hormonal changes. An increase in systemic regulatory T cell levels in pseudopregnant females after mating with vasectomized males but not after pseudopregnancy induced mechanically confirms generation of regulatory T cells specific for paternal antigens. As for the mechanisms, neutralizing IL-10 abrogates the protective effect of regulatory T cells, whereas blockage of TGF-beta does not provide the same effect.
Our data confirm that regulatory T cells act in an antigen-specific manner during pregnancy and strongly suggest that IL-10 is involved in regulatory T cell-mediated protection of the fetus. These data contribute to the knowledge of the basic mechanisms regulating immune tolerance during pregnancy, a major biologic question with important medical implications.

CMV-specific central memory T cells reside in bone marrow.	CMV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood (PB) are characterized by a preponderance of effector and effector memory T cells. CMV-specific central memory T cells (T(CM)), which are considered crucial in maintaining long-term immunity, are rarely detectable in PB. In this study we have analyzed differentiation and function of CMV pp65-specific CD8(+) T cells in paired samples of human PB and BM using intracellular cytokine and tetramer staining. Overall frequencies of CMV pp65-specific T cells were similar in PB compared to BM; however, CMV-specific CD45RA(-)CCR7(+) T(CM) were almost exclusively detectable in BM, which was not related to a general accumulation of T(CM) in BM. In vitro, CMV-specific T cells could be more efficiently expanded from BM (median 128-fold, n=6) than from PB (median 72-fold, p=0.01). Taken together, these data show that the BM is a compartment harboring CMV-specific T(CM) and underline the concept of the BM as a secondary immune organ. CMV specific BM-derived T(CM) might be a valuable source for generating T cells for adoptive transfer.

Altered intestinal function in patients with chronic heart failure.	"We evaluated morphology and function of the gut in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).
Intestinal translocation of bacterial endotoxin may contribute to the inflammatory state observed in patients with CHF. The morphology and function of the gut may be abnormal.
We studied 22 patients with CHF (age 67 +/- 2 years, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] 31 +/- 1%, New York Heart Association functional class 2.3 +/- 0.1, peak VO2 15.0 +/- 1.0 ml/kg/min) and 22 control subjects (62 +/- 1 years, LVEF 68 +/- 2%, peak VO2 24.7 +/- 1.3 ml/kg/min). Bowel wall thickness was assessed by transcutaneous sonography, small intestinal permeability by the lactulose-mannitol test, passive carrier-mediated transport by D-xylose test, large intestinal permeability by sucralose test (5- and 26-h urine collection, high-performance liquid chromatography), and mucosal bacterial biofilm by fluorescence in situ hybridization in biopsies taken during sigmoidoscopy.
Chronic heart failure patients, compared with control patients, showed increased bowel wall thickness in the terminal ileum (1.48 +/- 0.16 mm vs. 1.04 +/- 0.08 mm), ascending colon (2.32 +/- 0.18 mm vs. 1.31 +/- 0.14 mm), transverse colon (2.19 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.08 mm), descending colon (2.59 +/- 0.18 mm vs. 1.43 +/- 0.13 mm), and sigmoid (2.97 +/- 0.27 mm vs. 1.64 +/- 0.14 mm) (all p < 0.01). Chronic heart failure patients had a 35% increase of small intestinal permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio: 0.023 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.017 +/- 0.001, p = 0.006), a 210% increase of large intestinal permeability (sucralose excretion: 0.62 +/- 0.17% vs. 0.20 +/- 0.06%, p = 0.03), and a 29% decrease of D-xylose absorption, indicating bowel ischemia (26.7 +/- 3.0% vs. 37.4 +/- 1.4%, p = 0.003). Higher concentrations of adherent bacteria were found within mucus of CHF patients compared with control subjects (p = 0.007).
Chronic heart failure is a multisystem disorder in which intestinal morphology, permeability, and absorption are modified.

Short-term anti-CD4 plus anti-TNF-alpha receptor treatment in allogeneic small bowel transplantation results in long-term survival.	"Despite improved immunosuppression, intestinal transplantation is still complicated by severe rejection episodes. To further improve immunosuppressive concepts, we evaluated an anti-CD4 antibody and an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibody for their immunosuppressive efficacy in the standard rat model of intestinal transplantation.
Intestinal transplantation was performed in the DA to Lewis combination, and recipients were treated perioperatively with either the anti-CD4 antibody RIB5/2 (day -1, 0, postoperative days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21), the anti-TNF antibody etanercept (60 min before reperfusion, postoperative days 3, 6, and 9) or a combination of both. Survival, histology and expression of immunologic mediator genes on days 3 and 4 after transplantation were investigated.
Treatment with anti-CD4 antibody alone (19.71+/-5.94) and the antibody combination (171.58+/-122.76) prolonged survival. The chemokine MIP-1alpha was significantly decreased in both anti-CD4 antibody treatment groups, possibly indicating an additional effect of the TNF-alpha blockade on the immune modulation by RIB5/2.
Our study demonstrated long-term graft survival in short-term treatment with a combination of an anti-CD4 antibody and a TNF-alpha antibody in more than 50% of the recipients of intestinal grafts. Such a combined approach could also be useful in clinical small bowel transplantation."

Interleukin-10 enhances the CD14-dependent phagocytosis of bacteria and apoptotic cells by human monocytes.	Monocytes are centrally involved in both specific and nonspecific immunity by secretion of regulatory immune mediators, phagocytosis, and presentation of antigens. Recent work has shown that monocytes can phagocytose bacteria independently from Fc gamma, complement, and scavenger receptors via a CD14-mediated process. Furthermore, incorporation of cells undergoing apoptosis is also mediated by CD14. In this study we investigated the regulation of monocytic CD14-dependent phagocytosis by the immunoregulatory cytokines interleukin-10 (IL-10), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). In this study an in vitro human whole-blood assay was used to test regulation of CD14-dependent phagocytosis of fluorescence-labeled E. coli by IL-10, IFN-gamma, and TGF-beta1 in monocytes from healthy donors. Phagocytosis by monocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and its regulation by IL-10 was also investigated. Finally, regulation of monocytic incorporation of apoptotic Jurkat cells by IL-10 was analyzed. For the CD14 blockade, murine anti-CD14 IgG2a antibody RMO52 was used. We observed that IL-10, suggested to be a monocyte-deactivating cytokine, strongly increased the monocytic CD14-dependent phagocytosis of E. coli. In contrast, IFN-gamma and TGF-beta1 depressed monocytic CD14 incorporation of E. coli. Compatible with this, IL-10 upregulated CD14 expression on monocytes, whereas IFN-gamma and TGF-beta1 downregulated its expression. IL-10 also increased the monocytic CD14-dependent and -independent phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. As expected, IL-10 strongly increased the CD14-independent phagocytosis but had no influence on the CD14-dependent phagocytosis of monocytes from a PNH patient. In conclusion, our data support a general role of IL-10 for activating monocytic scavenger functions, which are at least partly mediated by CD14. This is in line with the fact that IL-10 promotes the development of monocytes to macrophages. The contrasting effects of IL-10 and IFN-gamma on monocytic CD14-dependent phagocytosis may reflect a further mechanism counterbalancing antigen-presentation and nonimmunogenic scavenging of bacterial and cellular debris. TGF-beta, however, may be an inhibitor of both systems.

Heme oxygenase-1 ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion injury by targeting dendritic cell maturation and migration.	Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) has a major impact on short- and long-term renal allograft survival by increasing graft immunogenicity. Donor preconditioning by inducing heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) has been proven to exert cytoprotective and antiinflammatory effects on the graft, thus resulting in reduced graft immunogenicity. The study analyzed the effects and mechanisms of HO-1-mediated cytoprotection in rat kidney transplants exposed to cold preservation. We studied the differential gene-expression patterns of allografts after either short or long cold ischemia using a customized cDNA microarray. Prolonged cold ischemia led, 12 h after engraftment, to enhanced levels of adhesion molecules, heat-shock proteins, chemokines (CXCL10), and a remarkable upregulation of immunoproteasomes. Next we addressed the question whether induction of HO-1 or its byproduct carbon monoxide (CO) in organ donors targets these candidate markers related to enhanced immunogenicity. Induction of HO-1 or CO in organ donors 24 h before organ harvesting resulted in reduced mRNA levels of immunoproteasomes, MHC class II expression, and co-stimulatory molecules in the recipient's spleen, suggesting diminished migration and activation of donor dendritic cells. This observation suggests that HO-1/CO induction protects marginal allografts by inhibiting the immunogenicity of donor-derived dendritic cells.

Immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease that affects about 1.5% of the Caucasian population and is characterized by typical macroscopic and microscopic skin alterations. Psoriatic lesions are sharply demarcated, red and slightly raised lesions with silver-whitish scales. The microscopic alterations of psoriatic plaques include an infiltration of immune cells in the dermis and epidermis, a dilatation and an increase in the number of blood vessels in the upper dermis, and a massively thickened epidermis with atypical keratinocyte differentiation. It is considered a fact that the immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Since the early 1990s, it has been assumed that T1 cells play the dominant role in the initiation and maintenance of psoriasis. However, the profound success of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy, when compared with T-cell depletion therapies, should provoke us to critically re-evaluate the current hypothesis for psoriasis pathogenesis. Recently made discoveries regarding other T-cell populations such as Th17 and regulatory T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, the keratinocyte signal transduction and novel cytokines including interleukin (IL)-22, IL-23 and IL-20, let us postulate that the pathogenesis of psoriasis consists of distinct subsequent stages, in each of them different cell types playing a dominant role. Our model helps to explain the varied effectiveness of the currently tested immune modulating therapies and may enable the prediction of the success of future therapies.

Immunomodulatory therapies: challenges of individualized therapy strategies.

Examples of biomarker-guided therapies already in use are the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes (biomarker: blood glucose level) or the treatment of hypertension (biomarker: blood pressure). By contrast, most immunomodulatory therapies are given according to the patient's body weight or the patient's drug blood level rather than according to biomarkers indicating the patient's state of the immune system.

Ex vivo gene transfer of viral interleukin-10 to BB rat islets: no protection after transplantation to diabetic BB rats.	Allogeneic and autoimmune islet destruction limits the success of islet transplantation in autoimmune diabetic patients. This study was designed to investigate whether ex vivo gene transfer of viral interleukin-10 (vIL-10) protects BioBreeding (BB) rat islets from autoimmune destruction after transplantation into diabetic BB recipients. Islets were transduced with adenoviral constructs (Ad) expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) or vIL-10. Transduction efficiency was demonstrated by eGFP-positive cells and vIL-10 production. Islet function was determined in vitro by measuring insulin content and insulin secretion and in vivo by grafting AdvIL-10-transduced islets into syngeneic streptozotocin (SZ)-diabetic, congenic Lewis (LEW.1 W) rats. Finally, gene-modified BB rat islets were grafted into autoimmune diabetic BB rats. Ad-transduction efficiency of islets increased with virus titre and did not interfere with insulin content and insulin secretion. Ad-transduction did not induce Fas on islet cells. AdvIL-10-transduced LEW.1 W rat islets survived permanently in SZ-diabetic LEW.1 W rats. In diabetic BB rats AdvIL-10-transduced BB rat islets were rapidly destroyed. Prolongation of islet culture prior to transplantation improved the survival of gene-modified islets in BB rats. Several genes including those coding for chemokines and other peptides associated with inflammation were down-regulated in islets after prolonged culture, possibly contributing to improved islet graft function in vivo. Islets transduced ex vivo with vIL-10 are principally able to cure SZ-diabetic rats. Autoimmune islet destruction in diabetic BB rats is not prevented by ex vivo vIL-10 gene transfer to grafted islets. Graft survival in autoimmune diabetic rats may be enhanced by improvements in culture conditions prior to transplantation.

Loss of receptor on tuberculin-reactive T-cells marks active pulmonary tuberculosis.	"Tuberculin-specific T-cell responses have low diagnostic specificity in BCG vaccinated populations. While subunit-antigen (e.g. ESAT-6, CFP-10) based tests are useful for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection, there is no reliable immunological test for active pulmonary tuberculosis. Notably, all existing immunological tuberculosis-tests are based on T-cell response size, whereas the diagnostic potential of T-cell response quality has never been explored. This includes surface marker expression and functionality of mycobacterial antigen specific T-cells.
Flow-cytometry was used to examine over-night antigen-stimulated T-cells from tuberculosis patients and controls. Tuberculin and/or the relatively M. tuberculosis specific ESAT-6 protein were used as stimulants. A set of classic surface markers of T-cell naïve/memory differentiation was selected and IFN-gamma production was used to identify T-cells recognizing these antigens. The percentage of tuberculin-specific T-helper-cells lacking the surface receptor CD27, a state associated with advanced differentiation, varied considerably between individuals (from less than 5% to more than 95%). Healthy BCG vaccinated individuals had significantly fewer CD27-negative tuberculin-reactive CD4 T-cells than patients with smear and/or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis, discriminating these groups with high sensitivity and specificity, whereas individuals with latent tuberculosis infection exhibited levels in between.
Smear and/or culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis can be diagnosed by a rapid and reliable immunological test based on the distribution of CD27 expression on peripheral blood tuberculin specific T-cells. This test works very well even in a BCG vaccinated population. It is simple and will be of great utility in situations where sputum specimens are difficult to obtain or sputum-smear is negative. It will also help avoid unnecessary hospitalization and patient isolation."

Evidence for genetic susceptibility towards development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in solid organ recipients.	"Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a life-threatening complication after organ transplantation. The identification of risk factors for PTLD development is important for disease management. It has been shown that cytokine gene polymorphisms are associated with lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated diseases in nonimmunosuppressed patients. In the present case-control study, we analyzed the impact of -1082 interleukin (IL)-10, -308 tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (codon 10, 25), and +874 interferon (IFN)-gamma gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the late onset EBV-associated PTLD.
Out of 1,765 solid organ recipients, 38 patients with late-onset EBV-associated PTLD and 408 matched solid organ recipients were selected and enrolled in the study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for -1082IL-10, -308TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 (codon 10, 25), and +874IFN-gamma genes were analyzed by a sequence specific primer polymerase chain reaction and were related to the PTLD development, and the disease course and outcome.
The TGF-beta1 (codon 25) GG genotype was detected more frequently in controls than in PTLD patients (odds ratio=0.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.69, P=0.0022). The frequency of -1082 IL-10 GG genotype was also significantly higher in controls than in PTLD patients (odds ratio=0.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.25-1.0, P=0.044). There were no associations between -308TNF-alpha, TGF-beta1 codon 10, and +874IFN-gamma SNPs and PTLD. Disease course and outcome were not associated with any cytokine SNPs.
Polymorphisms in two key anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-beta, are associated with susceptibility to EBV-associated PTLD, suggesting that a shift in pro-/anti-inflammatory response is involved in the pathogenesis of PTLD."

Skin disease is prevented but nephritis is accelerated by multiple pregnancies in autoimmune MRL/LPR mice.	The role of pregnancy in the progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is still poorly understood. We analysed the effect of repeated pregnancies in MRL/lpr mice, a murine model of SLE. Seven-week old female mice were used: multiparous mice underwent three consecutive pregnancies (M); age-matched virgin mice served as controls (V). Animals were harvested at 20 weeks of age. Skin lesions were characterized by hair loss and scabs in the dorsum of the neck. Virgin skins showed thickened dermis, fibrosis and mononuclear cell infiltrates, which were practically absent in M. This was accompanied by higher IFN-gamma and lower IL-10 mRNA expression levels in V compared to M skin. Plasma IFN-gamma protein levels were also upregulated in V versus M. However, survival and kidney function were dramatically reduced and accompanied by hypertension after multiple pregnancies. Kidney histology also showed markedly increased renal lesions in M. In contrast to plasma and skin levels, both IL-10 and IFN-gamma mRNA were lower in the kidneys of V versus M mice. Concluding our findings, the pathomechanisms of lupus kidney and skin disease may be regulated differently at the organ level during pregnancy. Both IFN-gamma and IL-10 may be important regulatory cytokines at the local level.

Intrarenal cytokine and chemokine gene expression and kidney graft outcome.	"Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to play an important role in various kidney graft diseases resulting in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy frequently found in case biopsies. To explore the role of various cytokines and chemokines in the long-term graft outcome, the transcription patterns of their genes in kidney allograft biopsies were evaluated.
The real-time RT-PCR was used to identify intragraft mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines in 74 kidney graft recipients and the results were correlated with histological and clinical parameters and long-term graft outcome.
We observed up-regulated IL-10 (p < 0.001), TGF-beta1, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES (p < 0.01) and TNF-alpha (p < 0.05) mRNA expression in patients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) as compared to controls. There were positive correlations between the mRNA expression of IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-10 (p < 0.01), TNF-alpha, MCP-1 (p < 0.05) and the proteinuria. The up-regulation of intrarenal MCP-1 in patients with CAN increased the risk for the graft failure within the next 42 months (OR 5.1, p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that proteinuria and higher intragraft expression of TGF-beta1 and MCP-1 predict a poor kidney graft outcome.

Risk stratification for renal transplantation after cardiac or lung transplantation: single-center experience and review of the literature.	"Long-term survival after heart (HTx) or lung (LuTx) transplantation increases the risk for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). After HTx ESRD was reported to enhance mortality, and kidney transplantation (KTx) was shown to improve survival. However, prognostic factors in ESRD after HTx or LuTx are largely unknown.
Single-center observational study in HTx and LuTx patients who accessed the KTx waiting list; baseline characteristics were correlated with mortality.
KTx was performed in 15 of 65 study patients. Survival was comparable on the KTx waiting list and in reference patients from the same center without ESRD. KTx significantly improved survival (5 years' survival 84.6% with KTx vs. 56.5% on the KTx waiting list, p = 0.030). None of the baseline parameters predicted mortality in the KTx group. Only on the KTx waiting list BMI (median 24.7 vs. 20.7; p < 0.05) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, median 63 vs. 53%, p < 0.008) significantly correlated with survival.
The risk for mortality after HTx or LuTx is not increased by ESRD, provided that patients meet access criteria for the KTx waiting list. KTx improves survival in ESRD after HTx or LuTx.

The influence of inducible costimulator fusion protein (ICOSIg) gene transfer on corneal allograft survival.	"The purpose of this paper is to analyse the effects of local or systemic administration of adenovirus type 5 encoding the inducible costimulator fusion protein (AdICOSIg) on its influence on prolonging corneal allograft survival.
The ICOSIg chimeric molecule was generated by fusing the murine ICOS to a rat FcIgG portion and a recombinant adenovirus (Ad) was made thereof. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/II mismatched rat corneal transplant model was used. The recipients were randomly assigned to receive ex vivo gene-modified corneas expressing either ICOSIg or a single i.p. injection (1.0 x 10(9) infectious particles) of AdICOSIg two days after transplantation and graft survival was analysed. Moreover, the influence of ICOSIg fusion protein on anti-adenovirus immunity also was investigated.
The ex vivo gene transfer of ICOSIg in cultured corneas resulted in high levels of ICOSIg protein in culture supernatants. However, neither ex vivo nor systemic gene therapy resulted in a significant prolongation of graft survival. Interestingly, the generation of anti-adenovirus antibodies could not be inhibited by systemic ICOSIg fusion protein expression.
Unlike CTLA4Ig, sole ICOSIg gene therapy is not a successful strategy for the prevention of allogeneic graft rejection in corneal transplantation."

A novel selective extracorporeal intervention in sepsis: immunoadsorption of endotoxin, interleukin 6, and complement-activating product 5a.	In sepsis, endotoxin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and complement-activation product 5a (C5a) trigger inflammatory cascades resulting in monocytic deactivation. When this occurs, the outcome is often uncontrolled infection, multiple organ dysfunction, and death. We tested here whether simultaneous reduction of systemic endotoxin, IL-6, and C5a levels could be achieved via selective extracorporeal immunoadsorption (IA) and whether this would restore monocytic responsiveness and improve organ function. Therefore, 33 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled in a prospective, 1:2 case-control matched, blinded endpoint evaluation trial. In addition to best supportive care, 11 of these patients (mean age, 57.8 +/- 2.2 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 23.7 +/- 1.6) received simultaneous endotoxin IA, IL-6 IA, and C5a IA on 5 consecutive days for 7.5 h each. Our observational end points were the course of monocytic immunity (monocytic HLA-DR expression) and other indices of inflammation and disease severity. In patients receiving IA, the mean circulating level of IL-6 was reduced from 361.7 +/- 116.0 to 38.2 +/- 15.2 pg/mL (P = 0.02), and of C5a from 297.6 +/- 43.1 to 79.2 +/- 14.5 ng/mL (P < 0.001). Two indices of endotoxemia were reduced also. Treated patients had lower C-reactive protein and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at day 7 (P = 0.004 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Monocytic HLA-DR improved in the treated patients but not in controls (P < 0.0001). Under treatment, HLA-DR was found to recover in all patients with immunoparalysis (4,993.6 +/- 1,162 to 15,295.3 +/- 2,197 molecules per cell; P = 0.002). Here, we demonstrate that simultaneously reducing circulating endotoxin, IL-6, and C5a levels by selective IA reverses monocytic deactivation and improves organ system functions. This novel strategy might open a new therapeutic avenue for an interventional extracorporeal treatment of patients with sepsis.

Immunology of pregnancy: cellular mechanisms allowing fetal survival within the maternal uterus.	Pregnancy success remains a fascinating phenomenon to immunologists as it defies the immunological rules of rejection. Although it was previously thought that the maternal immune system does not see the fetus, it is now well documented that fetal cells reach the maternal body and encounter host immune cells. Natural tolerance mechanisms following this interaction remain to be fully elucidated. This article reviews the current literature on mechanisms of adaptive immunity, with emphasis on regulatory T cells and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). We propose a scenario in which regulatory T cells create a tolerant microenvironment at the fetal-maternal interface characterised by the presence of tolerance-associated molecules such as HO-1, which has been shown to be of vital importance for fetal survival.

Salvage chemotherapy for refractory and relapsed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) after treatment with single-agent rituximab.	"Single-agent rituximab has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and tolerability in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) failing to respond to immunosuppression reduction (IR). This retrospective analysis was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of salvage therapy in recipients of solid organ transplants with progression of PTLD after rituximab first-line therapy.
Eleven patients who had received IR and single-agent rituximab were analyzed. Of these, 10 had received CHOP salvage chemotherapy. One patient with limited disease received tumor irradiation and further IR. Most patients (73%) had late PTLD (median onset of disease 145 months posttransplant), and most (83%) had monomorphic histology; 36% had EBV-association.
IR and irradiation therapy re-induced complete remission (CR) and allowed long-term disease control in a patient with polymorphic PTLD relapse. CHOP therapy achieved CR in five (50%) and partial remission (PR) in two (20%) patients. Four of five (80%) patients achieving CR remained in CR at a median follow-up of 44.2 months. Of the patients achieving PR, one is currently alive, and the second died from transplant rejection after converting to CR after consolidative chemotherapy. Patients with stable disease (two) and progressive disease (one) have died from PTLD. There was one possible CHOP-associated death (acute cardiac event) and two patients had to be switched to less-toxic monotherapies. Median overall survival was 46.5 months (95% confidence interval: 23.6-49.1 months).
CHOP salvage therapy achieved a favorable overall response rate of 70% in this setting, indicating that PTLD generally remains chemotherapy-sensitive after progression following first-line rituximab."

Identification of gene markers for the prediction of allograft rejection or permanent acceptance.	The clinical success of new treatment strategies aiming on inducing permanent graft acceptance will rely on the ability to determine whether specific unresponsiveness to donor alloantigens has developed and for how long it is maintained. To identify markers for such posttransplant monitoring, genes differentially expressed by graft infiltrating leukocytes during tolerance induction or rejection after kidney transplantation in rats were compared. A subsequently performed full kinetic analysis in two different transplant models, kidney and heart, in two species, rat and mouse identified two markers (TOAG-1, alpha-1,2-mannosidase) with high specificity and reproducibility, which are highly expressed during induction and maintenance of acceptance, and downregulated during rejection. Expression level of these markers showed a strong positive correlation with graft function. In addition, expression of both genes was downregulated in the peripheral blood and the graft prior to rejection, suggesting that these markers may be useful for monitoring in clinical transplantation where peripheral blood is the most easily accessible patient sample. Interestingly, downregulation of TOAG-1 and alpha-1,2-mannosidase expression occurred in graft infiltrating cells and expression of both genes was also downregulated after T-cell activation in vitro.

IL-22 induces lipopolysaccharide-binding protein in hepatocytes: a potential systemic role of IL-22 in Crohn's disease.	Crohn's disease (CD) is a common, chronic, inflammatory bowel disease characterized by intestinal infiltration of activated immune cells and distortion of the intestinal architecture. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-22, a cytokine that is mainly produced by activated Th1 and Th17 cells, was present in high quantities in the blood of CD patients in contrast to IFN-gamma and IL-17. In a mouse colitis model, IL-22 mRNA expression was elevated predominantly in the inflamed intestine but also in the mesenteric lymph nodes. IL-22BP, the soluble receptor for IL-22, demonstrated an affinity to IL-22 that was at least 4-fold higher than its membrane-bound receptor, and its strong constitutive expression in the intestine and lymph nodes was decreased in the inflamed intestine. To investigate the possible role of systemic IL-22 in CD, we then administered IL-22 to healthy mice and found an up-regulation of LPS-binding protein (LBP) blood levels reaching concentrations known to neutralize LPS. This systemic up-regulation was associated with increased hepatic but not renal or pulmonary LBP mRNA levels. IL-22 also enhanced the secretion of LBP in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 hepatoma cells in vitro. This increase was mainly transcriptionally regulated and synergistic with that of other LBP inducers. Finally, elevated LBP levels were detected in CD patients and the mouse colitis model. These data suggest that systemic IL-22 may contribute to the prevention of systemic inflammation provoked by LPS present in the blood of CD patients through its induction of hepatic LBP.

Brain death activates donor organs and is associated with a worse I/R injury after liver transplantation.	The majority of transplants are derived from donors who suffered from brain injury. There is evidence that brain death causes inflammatory changes in the donor. To define the impact of brain death, we evaluated the gene expression of cytokines in human brain dead and ideal living donors and compared these data to organ function following transplantation. Hepatic tissues from brain dead (n = 32) and living donors (n = 26) were collected at the time of donor laparotomy. Additional biopsies were performed before organ preservation, at the time of transplantation and one hour after reperfusion. Cytokines were assessed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cytometric bead array. Additionally, immunohistological analysis of tissue specimens was performed. Inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta and MIP-1alpha were significantly higher in brain dead donors immediately after laparotomy compared to living donors. Cellular infiltrates significantly increased in parallel to the soluble cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Enhanced immune activation in brain dead donors was reflected by a deteriorated I/R injury proven by elevated alanin-amino-transferase (ALT), aspartat-amino-transferase (AST) and bilirubin levels, increased rates of acute rejection and primary nonfunction. Based on our clinical data, we demonstrate that brain death and the events that precede it are associated with a significant upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and lead to a worse ischemia/reperfusion injury after transplantation.

Development of Kaposi's sarcoma under sirolimus-based immunosuppression and successful treatment with imiquimod.	Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a vascular neoplasm typically observed in the immunocompromised patient populations, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or transplant patients. KS can appear simultaneously at multiple sites as red to purple, maculo-papular or nodular cutaneous lesions sometimes showing a visceral extension. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive agent with potent antitumor activity, has been effective in combating post-transplant KS. However, an aggressive regimen of immunosuppression for therapy of severe acute rejection episodes may abolish the antitumor effects of sirolimus. The following is a description of KS development under immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus, and the successful treatment of KS lesions utilizing the topical application of imiquimod 5% cream, an immune response modifier.

Gene transfer of cyto-protective molecules in corneal endothelial cells and cultured corneas: analysis of protective effects in vitro and in vivo.	The loss of corneal endothelial cells plays a critical role in many corneal diseases and is a common phenomenon following cornea transplantation. In addition, the non-regenerative capacity of human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC) ultimately requires appropriate protection of corneal tissues during ex vivo storage to ensure vitality of the cells. However, only 70% of donor corneas can be used for grafting because of endothelial deficiencies. Corneal endothelial cell loss during storage is mainly induced by apoptotic cell death. This study was undertaken, for proof of principle, to investigate whether over-expression of cyto-protective molecules Bcl-x(L), Bag-1, and HO-1 prevents the loss of corneal endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that gene transfer of both Bcl-x(L) and HO-1 has cyto-protective effects on HCEC in vitro. However, gene transfer of a single cyto-protective molecule does not prevent its rejection upon transplantation in a MHC class I/II disparate rat model.

Reticulocytes and their immature fraction do not detect acute rejection after kidney transplantation.	"Early detection of an acute rejection episode is an important problem in monitoring transplant patients. Erythropoietin (EPO) production is diminished in patients suffering from chronic renal insufficiency or acute rejection. Therefore, a decrease of reticulocyte counts and of young reticulocytes might indicate the emergence of an acute rejection episode. This pilot study examined the value of reticulocyte parameters as indicators of acute rejection episodes.
Reticulocyte parameters were examined in 25 renal transplant patients. Initial immunosuppressants therapy was based on a combination of methylprednisolone, mycophenolatmofetil, cyclosporine and antithymocyte globulin or basiliximab, CellCept, cyclosporine, and ATG or Simulect. During the first 3 weeks after the procedure, blood samples were collected three times per week. Complete blood counts were performed on XE-2100 analyzers (Sysmex). Acute rejection was biopsy-proven.
Acute rejection episodes were not accompanied by significantly altered reticulocyte parameters. During the first weeks, the reticulocyte count or the immature fraction, respectively, did not differ between patients with delayed versus immediate onset of renal function: reticulocyte count 1.70 +/- 1.06% vs 1.58 +/- 1.10% and ratio of immature (high fluorescent) reticulocytes 22.8 +/- 7.9% vs 17.6 +/- 9.4%).
Reticulocyte counts and determination of the immature reticulocyte fraction were not significantly altered by an acute rejection episode. Various influences modulate the release of EPO and reaction of erythropoiesis upon an EPO stimulus."

Local overexpression of nerve growth factor in rat corneal transplants improves allograft survival.	"To investigate the effect and mechanisms of nerve growth factor (NGF) gene therapy to promote allograft survival in experimental rat corneal transplantation.
A rat major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I/II disparate corneal transplant model was used. Recipients were randomly assigned to receive either local Ad (Ad)-mediated gene transfer of NGF or a single intraperitoneal injection of AdNGF 1 day before transplantation. Moreover, immunosuppressive therapy was introduced by systemic coapplication of an Ad expressing CTLA4Ig. The efficacy of this treatment was examined by intracorneal mRNA expression analysis of cytokines and cytoprotective molecules by quantitative RT-PCR at day 12 after transplant. Further graft integrity and immune response against adenoviral vectors were investigated.
Local AdNGF-gene transfer significantly prolonged the mean survival time (MST) of rat corneal grafts (16.8 +/- 1.4 days) compared with control grafts (MST, 13.1 +/- 0.3 days; P < 0.03). In contrast, systemic AdNGF gene transfer did not result in improved corneal graft survival (MST, 15.2 +/- 1.0 days). RT-PCR analysis of cornea explants revealed diminished expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) and increased expression of antiapoptotic molecules. In addition, graft endothelial integrity was improved, as measured by the detection of apoptotic cells. Moreover, coapplication of CTLA4Ig further significantly improved graft survival and protective effects of local NGF gene therapy.
This is the first report showing the successful application of a neurotrophin gene therapy to prolong corneal graft survival in an experimental rat transplantation model. Moreover, immunomodulatory therapy further improves graft survival and demonstrates that both anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective mechanisms are involved in the prevention of corneal allograft rejection."

Acute esophageal necrosis (black esophagus) in the renal transplant recipient: manifestation of primary cytomegalovirus infection.	We report a severe case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis in a renal transplant recipient presenting as acute esophageal necrosis (AEN, 'black esophagus'). AEN is an uncommon entity that is a result of mucosal necrosis and has been described only a few times previously. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AEN due to a CMV infection. The disease was manifested by abdominal and epigastric pain, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Upper endoscopy showed acute esophageal necrosis. Ganciclovir therapy was initiated immediately and resulted in a complete remission of symptoms. We conclude that the possibility of CMV infection should be suspected in any patient presenting with cytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and epithelial gastrointestinal lesions in the first 6 months after transplantation, and that early viral detection and antiviral therapy can be lifesaving.

Analysis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-10, IL-6, and interferon-gamma gene polymorphisms in patients with chronic periodontitis.	"Cytokine gene polymorphisms may have an impact on the susceptibility to and progression of chronic periodontitis.

Reduced monocyte CD86 expression in postinflammatory immunodeficiency.	"Major surgery, polytrauma, stroke, and pancreatitis frequently lead to a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome that often predisposes patients to lethal infections. This temporary postinflammatory immunodeficiency is characterized by altered function of blood monocytes. These cells show strongly reduced inflammatory and antigen-presentation capacity. Diminished monocyte expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR is a well-established diagnostic marker of this immunodeficiency. To further characterize the monocytic cells in this clinical state, we analyzed their expression of CD86, the most important co-stimulatory molecule.
Analysis of blood samples that entered the clinical immunologic diagnostics and of cells from an in vitro model of postinflammatory immunodeficiency.

The expression of HLA-DR on monocytes and of CD86 and CD80 on monocytes and B cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Messenger RNA expression of CD86 was analyzed in isolated monocytes by real-time polymerase chain reaction on reverse transcribed. The normal range of monocyte CD86 expression in healthy subjects was established to be from 2128 to 5102 surface molecules per cell and was independent of age, gender, and leukocyte and monocyte count. The CD86 expression on monocytes in ICU patients correlated with HLA-DR expression. Approximately 40% of the ICU patients with long-term reduced monocyte HLA-DR expression had a long-term reduction of CD86 expression. Patients in whom the expression of both molecules was diminished had an unfavorable prognosis. The diminished number of CD86 surface molecules on monocytes was associated with reduced CD86 messenger RNA levels in these cells. The expression of CD86 in B cells was not diminished in immunodeficient patients. The expression of CD80 in both monocytes and B-cells was minimal in healthy donors and not clearly changed in patients.

A new qualitative interleukin-6 bedside test can predict pneumonia in patients with severe head injury--comparison to the standard Immulite test and a semiquantitative bedside test.	Severe head injury (SHI) leads to systemic immunosuppression, which is processed by central mechanisms and is associated with a high risk of pneumonia. The timely identification of an immunodepressed condition in SHI patients might help prevent infections by changing the intensive care strategy. The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate a new method for identifying immunodepression and predicting pneumonia. We correlated interleukin (IL)-6 levels determined by the standard test (Immulite) and performed by specialized laboratories with those obtained using the new bedside test (PicoScan) with the occurrence of pneumonia in patients with SHI. Thirty-two patients with isolated SHI were investigated. Analyses were performed on serum samples taken 2 to 24 hours after trauma. Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.924 (P<0.001) for IL-6 values determined by PicoScan versus Immulite and Spearman rho was 0.572 for visual interpretation versus Immulite (P=0.01). Immulite and PicoScan have a positive predictive value of 91% and 100%, respectively, and a negative predictive value of 76% and 86%. The present study investigated for the first time the determination of IL-6 concentrations by PicoScan in patients. Our findings show a good correlation with the results of the standard Immulite test and suggest that the PicoScan may be used as a handy tool to predict pneumonia in SHI patients.

Immunohistochemical detection of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha in human renal allograft biopsies.	Although it generally is accepted that renal hypoxia may occur in various situations after renal transplantation, direct evidence for such hypoxia is lacking, and possible implications on graft pathophysiology remain obscure. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are regulated at the protein level by oxygen-dependent enzymes and, hence, allow for tissue hypoxia detection. With the use of high-amplification HIF-1alpha immunohistochemistry in renal biopsies, hypoxia is shown at specific time points after transplantation with clinicohistologic correlations. Immediately after engraftment, in primarily functioning grafts, abundant HIF-1alpha is present and correlates with cold ischemic time >15 h and/or graft age >50 yr (P < 0.04). In contrast, a low HIF-1alpha score correlates with primary nonfunction, likely reflecting loss of oxygen consumption for tubular transport. Protocol biopsies at 2 wk show widespread HIF-1alpha induction, irrespective of histology. Beyond 3 mo, both protocol biopsies and indicated biopsies are virtually void of HIF-1alpha, with the only exception being clinical/subclinical rejection. HIF-derived transcriptional adaptation to hypoxia may counterbalance, at least partly, the negative impact of cold preservation and warm reflow injury. Transient hypoxia at 2 wk may be induced by hyperfiltration, hypertrophy, calcineurin inhibitor-induced toxicity, or a combination of these. Lack of detectable HIF-1alpha at 3 mo and beyond suggests that at this time point, graft oxygen homeostasis occurs. The strong correlation between hypoxia and clinical/subclinical rejection in long-term grafts suggests that hypoxia is involved in such graft dysfunction, and HIF-1alpha immunohistochemistry could enhance the specific diagnosis of acute rejection.

Heightened expression of the cytotoxicity receptor NKG2D correlates with acute and chronic nephropathy after kidney transplantation.	The activating cytotoxicity receptor NKG2D binds to stress-regulated molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) and UL-16-binding protein (ULBP)/retinoic acid early transcript (RAET) gene family. To assess whether acute allograft rejection leads to an induction of these inducible ligands and their receptor NKG2D, we examined the mRNA profiles in kidney transplant biopsies. Expression levels were correlated with the incidence of acute rejection (aRx) episodes and chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) proven by histology. Whereas MICA, ULBP1/3 and RAET1-E did not display heightened gene expression, elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA could be associated with aRx (p < 0.001). Immunohistology of kidney biopsies diagnosed with aRx revealed NKG2D+ cells in tubulointerstitial areas positive for CD8+ cells. Most importantly, elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA were associated with restricted long-term graft function assessed by the glomerular filtration rate at 6, 12 and 18 months posttransplantation. Induced NKG2D mRNA expression was still observable in biopsies diagnosed with CAN (p < 0.001), demonstrating a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to CD3, granzyme B and granulysin mRNA measurement. Significant elevated levels of NKG2D mRNA could be further detected in urine sediment prior to aRx, suggesting this receptor as a new candidate marker for the diagnosis of acute and chronic allograft rejection.

Predictive value of cytokine gene polymorphisms for the development of end-stage renal disease.	"Cytokines play a crucial role in different immunopathological conditions. Cytokine secretion is reported to be determined by polymorphisms in the cytokine genes. Since TNF-alfa and IL-10 are involved in regulation of inflammation, and TGF-beta 1 can induce fibrosis and renal insufficiency - dominant features of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we explored the hypothesis that polymorphisms of these cytokine genes may be possible genetic susceptibility factors for the progression of renal failure.
We studied the IL-10 (-1082), TNF-alfa (-308), TGF-beta 1 (codon 10;25) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms in 118 healthy donors and 103 patients with ESRD (44 hemodialysis patients with diabetic nephropathy and 59 hemodialysis patients with glomerulonephritis) using PCR-SSP.
Significant associations of ESRD with the TGF-beta 1 (codon 10) TT (odds ratio [OR] = 5.31; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.77-7.02; p<0.001) and IL-10 (-1082) GG (OR=2.35; 95% CI, 1.67-3.15; p<0.01) genotypes were found. Statistical analysis of genotype frequencies made separately for the underlying renal disease (diabetes or glomerulo-nephritis) revealed the same linkage trend: TGF-beta 1 (codon 10) TT and IL-10 (-1082) GG were associated with type 2 diabetic nephropathy (p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) and chronic glomerulonephritis (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). No significant differences in the TNF-alfa , TGF-beta 1 (codon 25) genotype distribution between healthy controls and patients with diabetic nephropathy- or glomerulonephritis-associated ESRD were detected.
Carriage of the TGF-beta 1 (codon 10) TT and IL-10 (-1082) GG genotypes may increase susceptibility to ESRD in German patients with type 2 diabetes or glomerulonephritis."

A vaccine for hypertension based on virus-like particles: preclinical efficacy and phase I safety and immunogenicity.	"Despite the availability of efficacious drugs, the success of treating hypertension is limited by patients' inconsistent drug intake. Immunization against angiotensin II may offer a valuable alternative to conventional drugs for the treatment of hypertension, because vaccines induce relatively long-lasting effects and do not require daily dosing. Here we describe the preclinical development and the phase I clinical trial testing of a virus-like particle (VLP)-based antihypertensive vaccine.
An angiotensin II-derived peptide was conjugated to the VLP Qbeta (AngQb). AngQb was highly immunogenic in mice and rats. To test for efficacy, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were immunized with 400 microg AngQb or VLP alone. Group mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was reduced by up to 21 mmHg (159 +/- 2 versus 180 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.001), and total angiotensin II levels (antibody-bound and free) were increased ninefold (85 +/- 20 versus 9 +/- 1 pmol/l, P = 0.002) compared with VLP controls. SHR treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (1 mg/kg per day by mouth) reached an SBP of 155 +/- 2 mmHg. Twelve healthy volunteers of a placebo-controlled randomized phase I trial were injected once with 100 microg AngQb. Angiotensin II-specific antibodies were raised in all subjects (100% responder rate) and AngQb was well tolerated.
AngQb reduces blood pressure in SHR to levels obtained with an ACE inhibitor, and is immunogenic and well tolerated in humans. Therefore, vaccination against angiotensin II has the potential to become a useful antihypertensive treatment providing long-lasting effects and improving patient compliance."

TIRC7 is induced in rejected human kidneys and anti-TIRC7 mAb with FK506 prolongs survival of kidney allografts in rats.	TIRC7 delivers essential signals during immune activation as antibodies targeting TIRC7 inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and Th1 cytokine expression in vitro and prolonged kidney and heart allograft survival in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy specimens from human renal allografts undergoing rejection despite treatment with Calcineurin inhibitors (CI) showed elevated TIRC7 expression. Accordingly, with a view to clinical application, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of a chimerized anti-TIRC7 mAb in combination with Tacrolimus (FK506) using a rat kidney transplantation model (DA to Lewis). The combination of sub-therapeutic doses of both compounds significantly (p<0.05) prolonged the median graft survival to 19.5 days compared to monotherapy with FK506 (median survival, 7d) or mAb against TIRC7 (7d). These results suggest a potential synergism of anti-TIRC7 mAb and FK506 action, which could be developed into a novel combination therapy in the clinic by lowering side effects of present CI treatment. Moreover, the identification of TIRC7 in graft infiltrating lymphocytes might serve as a diagnostic marker to detect allograft rejection.

Modified ELISPOT technique--highly significant inverse correlation of post-Tx donor-reactive IFNgamma-producing cell frequencies with 6 and 12 months graft function in kidney transplant recipients.	"Upcoming trials for immunosuppression minimization and tolerance induction require the development of reliable in vitro assays for monitoring cellular alloimmunity in transplant patients. The IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay represents a promising tool for monitoring alloreactive memory/effector T cells. As T lymphopenia is a common finding during the early post-transplant (post-Tx) period, the IFN-gamma ELISPOT technique was here modified by using ELISPOT responder cells with enhanced percentage and standardized number of 200,000 T cells per well.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) of kidney transplant recipients were depleted of CD14+ and CD15+ cells to increase the percentage of T cells from average 47.8% to 71.5% before transplantation (pre-Tx) and from 39.7% to 74.9% post-Tx. The assay was tested in a population of 23 de novo renal transplant patients for clinical relevance. Before and at 2-3 times during the first 6 months post-Tx, IFN-gamma-producing donor-reactive as well as recall antigen-reactive cell frequencies (Candida, tuberculin, tetanus) were determined and correlated with outcome.
Pre-Tx donor-reactive ELISPOT frequencies were enhanced in patients with acute rejection compared to non-rejectors. Moreover, mean post-Tx donor-reactive ELISPOT frequencies showed a highly significant inverse correlation with renal function at 6 and 12 months. In contrast, recall antigen-reactive ELISPOT frequencies did not correlate with outcome.
Our results suggest that the modified donor-reactive ELISPOT approach might provide a useful surrogate marker for renal transplant outcome with possible utility especially in T-lymphopenic patients."

Murine pre-eclampsia induced by unspecific activation of the immune system correlates with alterations in the eNOS and AT1 receptor expression in the kidneys and placenta.	It remains arguable if an animal model can be of use in pre-eclampsia (PE) studies, as it is clearly a human disease not observed spontaneously in other species. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PE-like signs in mice inoculated with activated Th1 cells were accompanied by abnormal expression of molecules related to the regulation of blood pressure, viz. nitric oxide synthase enzymes (eNOS and iNOS) and angiotensin (Ang) II receptors (AT1R and AT2R), in order to analyse the relevance of this model for human disease. In this model, C57/BL6-mated BALB/c females received lymphocytes crosslined with anti-CD3 and cultured with interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12 to mimic PE pathology. Control mice received PBS. eNOS, iNOS and AT1R but not AT2R expression was augmented in the kidneys of PE-mice compared with control pregnant mice. The expression of eNOS but not of iNOS was augmented at the fetal-maternal interface of PE-mice as compared with the controls. NOSs regulate the synthesis of NO, a blood pressure and parturition mediator. As its expression is increased in PE patients, our data suggest that the Th1 cells-induced signs in this model are due to similar mechanisms as in humans. AT1R and AT2R mediate the effect of Ang II, and particularly the AT1R appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of human PE. The increased AT1R expression in the kidneys of PE-mice reinforces the theory that Th1 cells elicit a pathological situation closely resembling the human PE. All together, our data support the use of this animal model to study mechanisms underlying clinically overt PE.

The evaluation of psoriasis therapy with biologics leads to a revision of the current view of the pathogenesis of this disorder.	Psoriasis is a common chronic, recurring skin disease that is characterised by typical macroscopic and microscopic skin alterations. It is widely accepted that the immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Since the early 1990s, the dominant role of a subpopulation of T cells, so-called T1 cells, and their prominent cytokine IFN-gamma has been assumed in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Surprisingly, the comparison of the therapeutic success of treatments with recombinant proteins directed against defined immunological structures shows that those that directly affect T cells (alefacept, efalizumab, Hu-max-CD4, OKTcdr4a) were clearly less effective than those targeting TNF-alpha (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab). For this reason, the authors critically re-evaluated the view of psoriasis pathogenesis and postulate that in the majority of patients the T1 cells do not play a dominant role in the clinical, visible stage of this disease.

Effects of local and systemic viral interleukin-10 gene transfer on corneal allograft survival.	In this study, we explored the immunomodulatory effects of viral interleukin (IL) IL-10 after ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer in experimental corneal transplantation. Wistar-Furth rats were used as donors and major histocompatibility complex class I/II-disparate Lewis rats served as recipients. For ex vivo gene therapy donor corneas were either transfected with liposome/vIL-10 plasmid DNA mixtures or transduced with a vIL-10 expressing adenovirus vector (AdvIL-10). For in vivo studies, recipients were treated with AdvIL-10 intraperitoneally 1 day before transplantation. Graft survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier survival method. To monitor the efficacy of the therapy messenger RNA (mRNA) cytokine expression profiles in grafts and draining lymph nodes were analysed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, anti-adenovirus immunity was also investigated. Neither ex vivo liposome-mediated vIL-10 gene transfer nor ex vivo AdvIL-10 gene transfer led to prolonged corneal allograft survival. In contrast, corneal allograft survival was significantly prolonged in animals receiving systemic AdvIL-10 gene transfer. Moreover, only systemic vIL-10 gene therapy modulated the cytokine mRNA expression profile in draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, systemic AdvIL-10 gene transfer could not inhibit the generation of anti-adenovirus antibodies. Our data indicate systemic expression of the vIL-10 gene is required to modulate the cytokine expression profile in the draining lymph nodes, which might be a pre-requisite for the success of cytokine gene therapy.

Interleukin (IL)-19, IL-20 and IL-24 are produced by and act on keratinocytes and are distinct from classical ILs.	Due to their structural similarity, interleukin (IL)-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24 and IL-26 were combined with IL-10 in the so-called IL-10 family. To expand the knowledge on IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24, we systematically and quantitatively analysed the expression of these mediators and their receptor chains in vitro and in vivo under various conditions and in comparison with other IL-10 family members. In vitro, IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 were produced not only by activated immune cells, particularly monocytes, but also to a similar extent by keratinocytes. IL-1beta increased the expression of these mediators 1000-fold (IL-19) and 10-fold (IL-20 and IL-24) in keratinocytes. In vivo, these cytokines were expressed preferentially in inflamed tissues. The absence of either R1 chain for the two types of receptor complexes for these cytokines (IL-20R1/IL-20R2 and IL-22R1/IL-20R2) on immune cells implies that they cannot act on these cells. In fact, IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 did not induce activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) molecules in immune cells. Instead, several tissues, particularly the skin, tissues from the reproductive and respiratory systems, and various glands appeared to be the main targets of these mediators. Keratinocytes expressed both receptor complexes; however, the expression of IL-22R1 was 10 times higher than that of IL-20R1. Interferon-gamma further increased the expression of IL-22R1 and decreased that of IL-20R1, suggesting that under T1 cytokine conditions these mediators primarily affect keratinocytes via the IL-22R1/IL-20R2 complex. In summary, these data support the notion that IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 are distinct from classical ILs and constitute a separate subfamily of mediators within the IL-10 family.

TIRC7 inhibits T cell proliferation by modulation of CTLA-4 expression.	Ab targeting of TIRC7 has been shown previously to inhibit T cell proliferation and Th1 lymphocyte-associated cytokine production. In this study, we demonstrate that Ab targeting of TIRC7 induces early cell surface expression of CTLA-4. The majority of stimulated CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells coexpress CTLA-4 and TIRC7. Similar to CTLA-4, TIRC7 rapidly accumulates at the site of Ag adhesion upon T cell activation. TIRC7 seems to colocalize with CTLA-4 in human T cells, and both molecules are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, indicating they share intracellular transport systems. Moreover, Ab targeting of TIRC7 results in an early activation of CTLA-4 transcription. The inhibition of cell proliferation mediated by TIRC7 is dependent on CTLA-4 expression because the TIRC7-mediated inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and cytokine expression are abolished by Ab blockade of CTLA-4. Splenocytes obtained from CTLA-4-deficient mice are not responsive to TIRC7 Ab targeting. Thus, TIRC7 acts as an upstream regulatory molecule of CTLA-4 expression.

Induction of carbon monoxide in donor animals prior to organ procurement reduces graft immunogenicity and inhibits chronic allograft dysfunction.	"Nonspecific inflammatory damages occurring prior to organ transplantation reduce long-term graft survival. Here, we tested the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) induction by methylene chloride (MC).
Fischer-344 (F-344 Rat) or Dark Agouti (DA Rat) donor animals were either treated with MC four hours prior to organ removal or remained untreated. Kidneys were transplanted into Lewis (LEW) recipients. The low responder strain combination (F-344-->LEW) was studied for long-term graft changes. Dendritic cells (DCs) migration and early changes were followed in additional groups of a high responding donor/recipient strain combination (DA-->LEW). Native kidneys of uninephrectomized, age-matched normal animals served as controls.
Following MC application COHb peaked within two hours in donor animals. Renal function and morphology improved significantly in renal allografts of CO induced donor animals and were comparable to native controls long-term (24 wks). Early after transplantation (24 hr) donor-derived DCs, CD4+ T-cells and alloreactive T-cells were significantly reduced following the engraftment of organs from treated donors. In addition, a trend towards a Th1/Th2 shift and a significant intragraft reduction of CD3 mRNA expression was observed.

An anti-major histocompatibility complex class I intrabody protects endothelial cells from an attack by immune mediators.	"In vitro endothelialization has significantly improved the overall outcome of artificial prostheses in cardiovascular bypass surgery. A drawback of this tissue-engineering method remains the limited availability of suitable autologous endothelial cells (EC), especially in aged patients. Allogeneic EC with high proliferative capacity represent a potentially valuable alternative to a patient-specific vascular transplant. However, such cells carry the risk of being rejected due to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) mismatches.
We investigated the effects of a very potent, intracellularly expressed antibody directed against MHC class I molecules, referred to as alpha-rat MHC I single chain variable fragment (sFv) intrabody. The intrabody was stably expressed in rat aortic EC (RAEC) following lentiviral vector-mediated gene transfer. The functional consequence of the MHC I down-regulation was tested in an allogeneic setting in two different in vitro assays.
Stable expression of the alpha-rat MHC I sFv intrabody resulted in a highly efficient depletion of surface MHC I. Thereby those RAEC which displayed low MHC I levels over extended periods of time were protected against killing by allo-specific, cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and by allo-antibody/complement-mediated lysis.
These results demonstrate that intrabody-mediated down-regulation of MHC I reduces the immunogenicity of RAEC which may provide a suitable alternative supply for the lining of vascular prostheses."

Rat cytomegalovirus infection interferes with anti-CD4 mAb-(RIB 5/2) mediated tolerance and induces chronic allograft damage.	In order to assess the role of heterologous immunity on tolerance induction (TI) by signal 1 modification, the influence of rat cytomegalovirus infection (RCMVI) on TI by a non-depleting monoclonal anti-CD4 mAb (monoclonal antibody) (RIB 5/2) in a rat kidney transplant (KTx) model was investigated. Orthotopic rat KTx (Dark Agouty (DA)-->Lewis (LEW)) was performed after TI with RIB 5/2 [10 mg/kg body weight (BW); day -1, 0, 1, 2, 3; i.p. (intraperitoneal route)]. RCMVI (5x10E5 Plaque forming units [PFU] i.p.) was simultaneously conducted to KTx, 50 days after KTx, and 14 days before and after KTx. RIB 5/2 induced robust allograft tolerance even across the high-responder strain barrier. RCMVI broke RIB 5/2-induced tolerance regardless of the time of RCMVI but did not induce acute graft failure during the 120 days follow-up. RCMVI induced a significant chronic deterioration of allograft function (p<0.01) and enhanced morphological signs of chronic allograft damage (p<0.05). Cellular infiltrates and major histo-compatibility complex (MHC)-expression were more pronounced (p<0.05) in the infected groups. RCMVI induced not only RCMV-specific T-cell response but also enhanced the frequency of alloreactive T cells. RCMV interferes with anti-CD4 mAb-induced tolerance and leads to chronic allograft damage. The data we presented suggest a potentially important role of viral infections and their prophylaxis in clinical TI protocols.

Treatment of solid organ transplant recipients with autologous Epstein Barr virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).	We have investigated the in vivo safety, efficacy, and persistence of autologous Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for the treatment of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients at high risk for EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). EBV-CTLs generated from 35 patients expanded with normal kinetics contained both CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes and produced significant specific killing of autologous EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Twelve SOT recipients at high risk for PTLD, or with active disease, received autologous CTL infusions without toxicity. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring of EBV-DNA showed a transient increase in plasma EBV-DNA suggestive of lysis of EBV-infected cells, although there was no consistent decrease in virus load in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. Interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay and tetramer analysis showed an increase in the frequency of EBV-responsive T cells, which returned to preinfusion levels after 2 to 6 months. None of the treated patients developed PTLD. One patient with liver PTLD showed a complete response, and one with ocular disease has had a partial response stable for over one year. These data are consistent with an expansion and persistence of adoptively transferred EBV-CTLs that is limited in the presence of continued immunosuppression but that nonetheless produces clinically useful antiviral activity.

Rapid whole blood flow cytometric test to detect ICOS deficiency in patients with common variable immunodeficiency.	"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common primary immunodeficiency. With respect to underlying defects it comprises a heterogeneous group of deficiencies. For some patients, distinct phenotypical abnormalities have been described, e.g. partial CD40L deficiency or complete ICOS deficiency. For the diagnosis of CD40L deficiency, a rapid whole blood flow cytometric method has been described several years ago. We aimed to determine if the same method can be used to diagnose ICOS deficiency.
Whole blood from 8 healthy volunteers was stimulated for 4 and 20 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. Induction of ICOS expression was analyzed on CD8-CD3+ lymphocytes using three-color flow cytometry. Blood from a patient with diagnosed ICOS deficiency was also analyzed.
Whole-blood stimulation with PMA and ionomycin for 20 h resulted in a significant induction of ICOS expression on CD8-CD3+ lymphocytes in healthy volunteers. Four-hour incubation also demonstrated ICOS upregulation but to a much lower extent. In CD8-CD3+ lymphocytes from an ICOS-deficient patient, no ICOS expression could be induced following 20 h of stimulation.

Intervention at the level of the neuroendocrine-immune axis and postoperative pneumonia rate in long-term alcoholics.	"Postoperative pneumonia is three to four times more frequent in patients with alcohol use disorders followed by prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Long-term alcohol use leads to an altered perioperative hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immunity.
The aim of this study was to evaluate HPA intervention with low-dose ethanol, morphine, or ketoconazole on the neuroendocrine-immune axis and development of postoperative pneumonia in long-term alcoholic patients.
In this randomized, double-blind controlled study, 122 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for aerodigestive tract cancer were included. Long-term alcohol use was defined as consuming at least 60 g of ethanol daily and fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence. Nonalcoholic patients were included but only as a descriptive control. Perioperative intervention with low-dose ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight per day), morphine (15 mug/kg body weight per hour), ketoconazole (200 mg four times daily), and placebo was started on the morning before surgery and continued for 3 d after surgery. Blood samples to analyze the neuroendocrine-immune axis were obtained on the morning before intervention and on Days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery.
In long-term alcoholic patients, all interventions decreased postoperative hypercortisolism and prevented impairment of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte type 1:type 2 ratio. All interventions decreased the pneumonia rate from 39% to a median of 5.7% and shortened intensive care unit stay by 9 d (median) compared with the placebo-treated long-term alcoholic patients.

Immunologic effector mechanisms of a standardized mistletoe extract on the function of human monocytes and lymphocytes in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.	Even though mistletoe extracts have been in clinical use for centuries their exact mode of action is still unknown. Currently, the application scheme for registered preparations is a dose-escalating scheme to thus reduce side effects. In this study, healthy controls and patients were evaluated for their immunologic response to treatment with a standardized mistletoe extract (Iscador). It shows a strong effect as adjuvant that induces TNF-alpha and IL-12, which was partly mediated via CD14. Desensitization of the TNF-alpha response could be shown after repeated application in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Iscador induces a specific lymphocyte sensitization upon multiple injections and production of IgG1- and IgG3 -mistletoe antibodies. Remarkably, a systemic bystander effect (heterologous immunity against other recall antigens) was observed after long-term treatment. In conclusion, dose-escalation reduces the monocyte-related clinical side effects. A T-lymphocyte sensitization stimulates mainly a specific Th1 response. The most interesting clinical long-term effect is the bystander stimulation of various memory T cells that might mediate in vivo antitumor and antiinfectious T-cell response under mistletoe-extract immunization.

C60 thin film growth on graphite: Coexistence of spherical and fractal-dendritic islands.	The initial growth stage of C(60) thin film on graphite substrate has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy in ultrahigh vacuum at room temperature. The C(60) layer grows in a quasi-layer-by-layer mode and forms round, monolayer high islands on the graphite surface. The islands are confined by terraces on the graphite surface and the mobility of C(60) fullerenes across steps is low in all layers. The second and all subsequent layers adopt a fractal-dendritic shape, which was confirmed by calculating the fractal dimension (D=1.74 prior to island coalescence) and is in agreement with a diffusion limited aggregation. The profound differences between the growth of C(60) layers on graphite (first layer) and on C(60) surfaces (second and higher layers) are caused by the restriction of the C(60) mobility on the highly corrugated fullerene surfaces. The orientation of the fractal islands follows the hexagonal symmetry of the densely packed (111) surface of the fullerene lattice, which introduces a bias in the direction of molecule movement. The differences in surface topography on the nanoscale determine the mode of film growth in this van der Waals bonded system.

Living kidney donation: anemia and inflammation in the early postoperative period.	Studies on living donor kidney transplantation primarily address the recipients; few publications focus on kidney donors. The aim of the present study was to detect changes in and compensations of defined parameters of anemia and inflammation in the immediate postnephrectomy period. We included six living kidney donors who underwent an open anterior-extraperitoneal nephrectomy. We excluded donors with complications, such as significant blood loss or infection. Blood samples were taken before nephrectomy as well as on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7, and at discharge for measurements of hemoglobin (Hb), serum erythropoietin (Epo), reticulocytes (Reti), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and C-reactive protein (CRP). There was a significant decrease in Hb (>3 g/dL), reaching a maximum on day 3 followed by a significant threefold increase in Epo levels on day 5 and a nonsignificant elevation of Reti count. CRP increased approximately 80-fold on day 3. PTX3 showed a similar course, peaking on day 3 with an approximate 70-fold increase. After living donor nephrectomy, there was an unexpectedly pronounced inflammatory reaction in the absence of any signs of bacterial infection simultaneous with a significant decrease in Hb. These parameters improved during the hospital stay, in some cases they achieved the prenephrectomy level at discharge. These data may assist in interpreting laboratory results after nephrectomy among living kidney donors.

IL-22 regulates the expression of genes responsible for antimicrobial defense, cellular differentiation, and mobility in keratinocytes: a potential role in psoriasis.	IL-22 is an IFN-IL-10 cytokine family member, which is produced by activated Th1 and NK cells and acts primarily on epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-22, in contrast to its relative IFN-gamma, regulates the expression of only a few genes in keratinocytes. This is due to varied signal transduction. Gene expressions regulated by IL-22 should enhance antimicrobial defense [psoriasin (S100A7), calgranulin A (S100A8), calgranulin B (S100A9)], inhibit cellular differentiation (e.g., profilaggrin, keratins 1 and 10, kallikrein 7), and increase cellular mobility [e.g., matrix metalloproteinease 1 (MMP1, collagenase 1), MMP3 (stromelysin 1), desmocollin 1]. In contrast, IFN-gamma favored the expression of MHC pathway molecules, adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. The IL-22 effects were transcriptional and either independent of protein synthesis and secretion, or mediated by a secreted protein. Inflammatory conditions, but not keratinocyte differentiation, amplified the IL-22 effects. IL-22 application in mice enhanced cutaneous S100A9 and MMP1 expression. High IL-22 levels in psoriatic skin were associated with strongly up-regulated cutaneous S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and MMP1 expression. Psoriatic patients showed strongly elevated IL-22 plasma levels, which correlated with the disease severity. Expression of IL-22 and IL-22-regulated genes was reduced by anti-psoriatic therapy. In summary, despite similarities, IFN-gamma primarily amplifies inflammation, while IL-22 may be important in the innate immunity and reorganization of epithelia.

TGF-beta1 mRNA upregulation influences chronic renal allograft dysfunction.	Acute rejection (AR) is a dominant risk factor for developing chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) after kidney transplantation. CAN is characterized by progressive interstitial fibrosis. It has been associated with increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 expression, however, kinetic studies are absent. We investigated whether intragraft TGF-beta1 expression in various causes of early graft dysfunction may influence late renal allograft dysfunction. A total of 174 human renal biopsies were quantified for TGF-beta1 mRNA expression using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Expression levels were correlated with the Banff histopathological grades, TGF-beta1 immunohistology, and clinical follow-up. TGF-beta1 was most markedly upregulated in AR, CAN, and acute tubular necrosis - delayed graft function compared to non-rejecting controls (P < 0.001). TGF-beta1 expression was heightened in borderline changes (P < 0.01), recurrence of glomerulonephritis, and cyclosporine toxicity (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between intragraft TGF-beta1 expression during AR and short-term outcome of a rejection episode. TGF-beta1 gene overexpression during CAN has been shown to be associated with the increased risk for renal allograft dysfunction 18 months after biopsy (odds ratios 9.9 vs 3.2, respectively). Intragraft TGF-beta1 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in both AR and CAN. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that TGF-beta1 might play a key role in chronic allograft dysfunction.

Epstein-Barr viral load in whole blood of adults with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder after solid organ transplantation does not correlate with clinical course.	Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is closely linked to primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. A defect of EBV specific cellular immunity is postulated to play a pivotal role in the etiology of PTLD, but there is some debate as to whether EBV load in the peripheral blood of transplant patients predicts onset of PTLD or relapse after treatment. The current prospective, single-center study was undertaken to investigate the impact of therapy on EBV load in adult patients with PTLD. Fifteen patients with PTLD after solid organ transplantation were included and of these, seven had EBV-associated PTLD. All 15 patients received Rituximab as primary therapy. In cases of treatment failure or relapse after Rituximab treatment, patients received polychemotherapy according to the cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone regimen. At onset of PTLD, the median EBV load in the peripheral blood of patients was higher in EBV-associated PTLD than PTLD with no associated EBV infection. After Rituximab therapy, four of seven patients with EBV-associated PTLD achieved long-lasting complete remissions. However, in two of these patients, EBV load increased to reach levels as high as those recorded at onset of PTLD. Another patient showed a dramatic decline of EBV load after the first dose of Rituximab while suffering from progressive disease. The other patient relapsed after Rituximab monotherapy, but his viral load stayed low. In total, discordance in EBV load and clinical course was observed in five of the seven patients with EBV-associated PTLD. We conclude that in adult patients with PTLD, EBV load does not correlate with treatment response and is not suitable as a predictive marker for PTLD relapse.

Anti-P- and E-selectin therapy prevents abortion in the CBA/J x DBA/2J combination by blocking the migration of Th1 lymphocytes into the foetal-maternal interface.	Leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues comprises dynamic interactions between immune and endothelial cells through events controlled by adhesion molecules, e.g., P- and E-selectins, which mediate Th1 cells recruitment after injury. Since miscarriage is known to be a Th1 event and selectins are expressed at the murine foetal-maternal interface, the purpose of our study was to investigate whether blocking P- and E-selectins before implantation could inhibit Th1 migration into the foetal-maternal interface and thus prevent foetal rejection. DBA/2J-mated CBA/J females were treated with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against P-selectin or with both, anti-P- and anti-E-selectins combined on days 2 and 4 of pregnancy. PBS-treated females served as controls. Our data revealed a significant improvement in pregnancy outcome in both treated groups compared to the control, which is due to the effectiveness of the mAb against P-selectin, since the treatment with anti-E-selectin alone could not prevent abortion. We further observed that there was diminished Th1 cytokine production by decidual immune cells in all treated groups in comparison to the controls. Our data first confirm the important role of P-selectin in mediating the extravasation of abortive cells, while opening new therapeutic opportunities.

Early post-transplant urinary IP-10 expression after kidney transplantation is predictive of short- and long-term graft function.	The early identification of renal transplant recipients at enhanced risk of developing acute and subclinical rejection would allow individualized adjustment of immunosuppression before functional graft injury occurs and would exclude these patients from drug-weaning studies. Protein and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based analyses of candidate markers in urine open the opportunity to closely monitor kidney-transplanted patients non-invasively. The chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10; CXCL10) might be an interesting candidate to uncover ongoing immune processes within the graft. Urine samples from kidney-transplanted recipients were retrospectively analyzed for IP-10 mRNA and protein expression. IP-10 levels were correlated with the incidence of acute rejection episodes proven by histology and long-term graft function assessed by the glomerular filtration rate 6 months post transplantation. IP-10 expression in urine identified patients with ongoing acute rejection episodes several days before a biopsy was indicated by rising serum creatinine levels. Most importantly, elevated levels of urinary IP-10 protein within the first four postoperative weeks were predictive of graft function at 6 months even in the absence of acute rejection. These data reveal a correlation between elevated IP-10 expression in urine at early time points post-transplantation and intragraft immune activation that leads to acute rejection and compromised long-term graft function.

Intrarenal gene expression of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines in chronic proteinuric glomerulopathies.	Proteinuria has been recently shown to be an independent risk factor for the progression of chronic nephropathies, but the actual mechanisms by which urinary protein load damages renal tissue in humans remain unsolved. Using real-time RT-PCR method we evaluated intrarenal mRNA expression of various cytokines and chemokines in patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy (IgAN, n=11), membranous nephropathy (MN, n=6) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, n=6) who exhibited proteinuria over 0.5 g/day. There was a significant positive correlation between the proteinuria extent and the intrarenal RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) mRNA expression in patients with IgAN, a similar trend was also observed in patients with MN and FSGS. There were no clear relationships between the proteinuria and intrarenal mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta1 and monocyte chemoattractant peptide-1. There were no differences in the pattern of cytokine mRNA expression between different glomerulopathies. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that lymphocytes, macrophages and their products provoke tissue injury in response to proteinuria independently of the nature of renal diseases in man.

Antibody targeting of TIRC7 results in significant therapeutic effects on collagen-induced arthritis in mice.	TIRC7 is a cell surface molecule which is expressed in T and B lymphocytes and negatively regulates their function. Anti-TIRC7 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibited T cell memory response to recall antigens. Up-regulation of TIRC7 on lymphocytes from joint tissue of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and mice with collagen induced arthritis (CIA) suggested TIRC7 as a novel target to promote anti-inflammatory reaction. Anti-TIRC7 mAb administration significantly inhibited the induction and progression of CIA and the anti-collagen IgG1 and IgG2a antibody response. Combination therapy of anti-TIRC7 mAb and soluble TNF-alpha receptor demonstrated an increased inhibitory effect over the single compounds on CIA. The results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of TIRC7 targeting with mAb in diseases associated with exaggerated T and B cell responses.

Influence of local and systemic CTLA4Ig gene transfer on corneal allograft survival.	"To analyse the effects of local (ex vivo) or systemic (in vivo) administration of adenovirus type 5 encoding CTLA4Ig (AdCTLA4Ig) on its influence to prolong corneal allograft survival and to study the underlying mechanisms.
A MHC class I/II mismatched rat corneal transplant model was used. Recipients were randomly assigned to receive ex vivo gene-modified corneas expressing either CTLA4Ig, CTLA4Ig/IL-10 or a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (1.0 x 10(9) or 1.0 x 10(10) infectious particles) of AdCTLA4Ig 1 day before transplantation and graft survival was analysed. The immunoregulatory effect of this treatment was examined by analysing intra-graft cytokine mRNA expression pattern at day 12 post-transplant. The anti-adenovirus immunity also was investigated.
Ex vivo gene transfer resulted in a modest but significant prolongation of graft survival (p = 0.0036 compared to no treatment). In contrast, systemic gene therapy (1.0 x 10(9) or 1.0 x 10(10) infectious particles) significantly prolonged graft survival (p = 0.0007 and 0.0001, respectively, compared to no treatment). Systemic (1.0 x 10(10) infectious particles) therapy resulted in frequent indefinite survival of allogeneic grafts which was not observed in the other therapeutic regimens. Moreover, systemic therapy prevented the intra-graft accumulation and activation of T cells and resulted in a reduced mRNA expression of both TH1 and TH2 cytokines. The generation of anti-adenovirus antibodies was also efficiently inhibited.
CTLA4Ig gene therapy is a successful strategy for the prevention of allogeneic graft rejection in corneal transplantation. Our work has further elucidated the mechanisms of corneal allograft rejection which may lead to novel therapeutic strategies."

HLA type-independent method to monitor polyoma BK virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity.	(Re)activation of quiescent viral diseases is a major problem in immunosuppressed transplant patients. Polyoma BK virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) caused by active polyoma BK virus (BKV) infection became a main reason for graft loss in kidney transplantation. After diagnosis, most transplant centers react by reducing immunosuppression (IS) to allow the immune system to control the infection. However, the impact of reduced IS on BKV immunity is not well researched. Here we present an HLA type-independent method to monitor BKV-specific T-cell immunity. Applying our method, viral protein 1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in patients with serum BKV-DNA levels >250 000 copies/mL. In addition, specific T-cell responses were also found in allograft-infiltrating cells. The method can be used to assess the impact of decreased immunosuppression on BKV immunity and to clarify the role of specific T cells in the pathogenesis of PVAN. We strongly recommend its implementation in future clinical studies.

Improved long-term graft survival after HO-1 induction in brain-dead donors.	Brain death (BD) of the donor, a risk factor uniquely relevant for organs derived from cadaver donors, influences organ quality by induction of various inflammatory events. Consequently ischemia/reperfusion injury is deteriorated and acute and chronic rejections accelerated. Donor treatment might be an approach to improve the quality of the graft. The induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) has been shown to exert beneficial effects in living-donor transplantation models. Therefore, we examined the impact of donor treatment with the selective inducer of HO-1, cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), on organ quality and transplant outcome in a standardized BD model in a F344-->LEW kidney transplant rat model. Immediately after BD induction, donor animals were administered a single dose of CoPP (5 mg/kg) and in control groups, HO-1 activity was blocked with zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP, 20 mg/kg). Recipients of organs from brain-dead donors treated with CoPP survived significantly better than those from untreated brain-dead donors (p < 0.05) and intra-graft analysis showed improved histology (p < 0.05). Blockade of HO-1 with ZnPP decreased the survival rates (p < 0.05) comparable to untreated brain-dead donors. Our results demonstrate that HO-1 induction by one single treatment of CoPP in brain-dead donors leads to enhanced allograft survival.

Increased intracranial pressure induces a rapid systemic interleukin-10 release through activation of the sympathetic nervous system.	There is a bi-directional communication between the immune and central nervous system. In this context, it is known that patients with traumatic brain injury suffered from systemic immunodepression and an increased risk to develop infectious complications. We investigated the role of an increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and sympathetic activation on systemic immune changes. A sustained increase in ICP was achieved by inflation of a subdural balloon. At different time points, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-10, were measured. Furthermore, the effect of a sympathetic blockade by co-administration of the beta2-adreoreceptor antagonist, propranolol, was evaluated. Finally, we examined the impact of epinephrine infusion on blood IL-10 levels. We showed that an increase in ICP with activation of the sympathetic nervous system was able to induce systemic release of IL-10. This effect was blocked by administration of the beta2-adreoreceptor antagonist. Furthermore, epinephrine infusion directly induced systemic release of IL-10. Our data suggested that sympathetic activation with release of epinephrine may induce systemic immunodepression with risk of infectious complications in brain-injured patients.	Acta neurochirurgica.

Allergoid-specific T-cell reaction as a measure of the immunological response to specific immunotherapy (SIT) with a Th1-adjuvanted allergy vaccine.	"Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is believed to modulate CD4+ T-helper cells. In order to improve safety, SIT vaccines are often formulated with allergoids (chemically modified allergens). Interaction between T-cells and allergoids is necessary to influence cellular cytokine expression. There have been few reports on identification the early cellular effects of SIT.
Patients allergic to grass and/or mugwort pollen (n= 21) were treated with a 4-shot allergy vaccine (Pollinex Quattro) containing appropriate allergoids (grass/rye and/or mugwort) adsorbed to L-tyrosine plus a Th1 adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Fourteen grass-allergic patients served as untreated controls. Using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these patients, an optimized lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was employed to monitor the in vitro proliferative response of T-cells to an allergoid challenge (solubilised Pollinex Quattro) before the first and last injection and then 2 and 20 weeks after the final injection. Control challenges utilised preparations of a similar pollen vaccine without the adjuvant MPL and a tree pollen vaccine with and without MPL.
The LTT showed increased LTT stimulation indices (SI) in 17/20 SIT patients when the solublised vaccine preparation was used as a challenge before the last injection and 2 weeks after, in comparison to pre-treatment levels. Twenty weeks after therapy, the SI decreased to baseline level. A vaccine challenge without MPL gave lower SI levels. A challenge of a clinically inappropriate tree allergoid vaccine gave no response, and a nontreated group also showed no response.
Following a short-course SIT adjuvated with MPL, challenges of allergoids were shown to activate allergen-specific T cells in vitro. There was an additional stimulating effect when the challenge was in combination with MPL. There were no non-specific effects of MPL, shown by the tree allergoid/MPL control. The timing of the response was closely correlated to the treatment course; reactivity fell two weeks after the final injection and 20 weeks later it was at baseline level. Thus an immunological response to SIT was detected after very few injections. This methodology could provide a basis for monitoring the immediate progress of allergy vaccinations."

Identification of dialysis patients with panel-reactive memory T cells before kidney transplantation using an allogeneic cell bank.	Donor-reactive cellular sensitization does not routinely suggest humoral sensitization and vice versa, but both predict poor kidney transplant outcome. Irrespective of donor reactivity, panel-reactive antibody (PRA) screening identifies patients who are at enhanced risk. Therefore, it was hypothesized that panel-reactive memory T cell reactivity (PRT) might be an additional risk assessment factor of dialysis patients who are on the transplant waiting list. IFN-gamma-enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot memory T cell frequencies were determined in 10 healthy volunteers and 41 hemodialysis patients using for stimulation an allogeneic cell bank (ACB) from 17 healthy individuals who represented the most frequent white HLA antigens. Positive responses to ACB were analogous to PRA defined as percentage of positive assays of the ACB sets. Hemodialysis patients expressed higher PRT levels compared with healthy volunteers. Five of 10 PRT++ patients were PRA negative, and only four of 10 PRA++ patients exhibited PRT reactivity, suggesting independence of humoral and cellular sensitization. Pretransplantation PRT testing of recipients might improve individual risk assessment to make individualized therapy decisions.

Gold cluster formation on a fullerene surface.	The growth of Au clusters on a fullerene thin film was investigated by in situ photoelectron spectroscopy in the ultraviolet (UPS) and x-ray (XPS) regime. Due to its highly corrugated surface fullerene films provide a wide range of bonding sites which could be exploited as molecular templates and serve to create a cluster superstructure. To gain insight into the fullerene-Au interaction two types of experiments were performed: (i) the deposition of Au on a fullerene surface, and (ii) the deposition of fullerenes on a Au surface. In both experiments an island growth mode is observed. The deposition of submonolayer amounts of C60 onto a gold film showed that the main interaction of the two species is due to chemisorption of the first C60 monolayer. In addition a constant band bending in the fullerene film is detected, but the UPS valence-band spectra show that there is no charge transfer from the Au to the C60 lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. In the reverse experiment, the cluster growth of Au on the corrugated C60 surface, the analysis of the Au core level does not reveal a specific bonding or nucleation site for Au atoms and clusters. This is in contrast to observations with Si clusters, which prefer to reside in the troughs between the fullerene molecules. The Au clusters grow continually from a size of about 55 atoms for the early stages of growth up to 150 atoms for the deposition of a nominal coverage of 1.5 nm. These data are derived from an analysis of the d-band splitting and the Au 4f core-level shift due to delayed photohole relaxation. The thermal stability of the Au-clusters-covered fullerene film was investigated by annealing in situ up to temperatures of 650 degrees C. For temperatures up to 450 degrees C a continuous growth of the clusters is detected, which is accompanied by a slight drop in Au concentration in the range of XPS for annealing temperatures higher than 350 degrees C. This may be due to a ripening of the clusters. The presence of Au apparently delays fullerene sublimation. The film shows a very good thermal stability and even after annealing at 650 degrees C there is still a fullerene film detectable in the photoelectron spectroscopy spectra.

Induction of pre-transplant Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection by donor blood transfusion in EBV-seronegative recipients may reduce risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in adolescent renal transplant patients: report of two cases.	"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a life-threatening complication following organ transplantation. The greatest risk is seen in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seronegative patients receiving allografts from EBV-seropositive donors. We demonstrate a new approach of pre-transplant prophylaxis of EBV-related PTLD, suggesting that, prior to living-related renal transplantation, blood transfusion from an EBV-seropositive donor to an EBV-seronegative recipient could induce primary EBV infection in the recipient, developing EBV immunity and decreasing risk of PTLD.
Recipients underwent weekly donor-specific blood transfusion (3 x 100 mL) before transplantation. EBV-mRNA expression, viral load, serological tests, and clinical signs of EBV infection were assessed following blood transfusion.
We explored a new approach in 2 young EBV-seronegative renal allograft recipients. Both patients developed primary EBV infection following blood transfusion before transplantation and showed symptom-free seroconversion post-transplantation without persistent EBV activation. There were no signs of PTLD during 5-year follow-up.
A new effective and inexpensive approach is suggested for development of EBV immunity and probably for prophylaxis of EBV-associated PTLD."

Over-expression of heme oxygenase-1 by adenoviral gene transfer improves pregnancy outcome in a murine model of abortion.	Mammalian pregnancy is a complex phenomenon allowing the maternal immune system to support its allogeneic fetus. Physiological pathways protecting the fetus from rejection are thought to be comparable with those leading to allograft acceptance. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is known to protect locally against rejection in transplantation models due to its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective functions. Based on previous data on low HO-1 levels in placenta from mice undergoing abortion, we hypothesized that an up-regulation of HO-1 during pregnancy would avoid fetal rejection in the murine abortion combination CBA/J x DBA/2J, using BALB/c-mated CBA/J as normal controls. We injected pregnant mice undergoing abortion with 1 x 10(5) PFU of an adenoviral vector containing HO-1 and GFP (AdHO-1/GFP), and compared the pregnancy outcome with PBS- or 1 x 10(5) AdEGFP-treated abortion-prone mice and with PBS-treated normal pregnant mice. The abortion rate diminished significantly after adenoviral gene transfer of AdHO-1/GFP. The systemic and local IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio was augmented in AdHO-1-treated mice compared to abortion-prone mice. Interestingly, the HO-1 treatment up-regulated the ratio IL-10/TNF-alpha in spleen but not in decidual lymphocytes. HO-1-treated mice further showed diminished apoptosis rate and increased Bag-1 mRNA levels at the materno-fetal interface. Thus, we propose HO-1 as a key regulator of pregnancy success. HO-1 would exert its action by locally up-regulating the Th2/Th1 cytokine ratio and by further protecting tissues from apoptosis.

Regulatory T cells induce a privileged tolerant microenvironment at the fetal-maternal interface.	The mechanisms underlying immune tolerance during pregnancy are poorly understood. In this regard, Treg seem to play an important role in mediating maternal tolerance to the fetus. We proposed a crucial role of T regulatory cells (Treg) in avoiding immunological rejection of the fetus after observing diminished number and function of Treg in abortion-prone mice. We further confirmed the protective role of Treg during pregnancy by transferring pregnancy-induced Treg into abortion-prone mice, which prevented rejection. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms involved in Treg-mediated protection. As expected, Treg therapy prevented abortion, while expanding the peripheral and thymic Treg population. Surprisingly, the decidual levels of the Th1 cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were not diminished after therapy. Interestingly, the mRNA levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, TGF-beta and heme oxygenase-1 at the fetal-maternal interface were dramatically up-regulated after Treg transfer, while the levels of indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase remained unchanged. Our data suggest that Treg treatment can not prevent T cell infiltration or high Th1 levels but is able to create a privileged tolerant microenvironment at the fetal-maternal interface, further shedding light onto the molecular mechanisms involved in pregnancy tolerance.

The anti-CD14 antibody IC14 suppresses ex vivo endotoxin stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha in patients with chronic heart failure.	"Activation of the endotoxin (LPS) receptor, CD14, leads to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production. Plasma LPS activity is elevated in patients with severe chronic heart failure (CHF). An anti-CD14 antibody, IC14, blocks TNF production in healthy volunteers. It is not known whether IC14 prevents TNF production in CHF patients.
Blood from 20 CHF patients (age 64+/-2.1 years, NYHA class 2.2+/-0.1, LVEF 27+/-3%, mean+/-SEM) was pre-incubated with 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10 and 50 microg/mL IC14 for 1 h followed by incubation with 1 or 10 ng/mL LPS for 6 h. Fourteen subjects served as controls (58+/-2.4 years). LPS-stimulated TNF release was 76% and 60% greater at 1 and 10 ng/mL LPS, respectively, in CHF patients versus controls (p=0.07 and p=0.008). IC14 at concentrations of 5.0, 10 and 50 microg/mL substantially reduced TNF production in response to stimulation with LPS (all p<0.05). CD14 receptor density was similar in patients and controls. In controls, but not in CHF patients, there was a positive correlation between CD14 receptor density and TNF production (r=0.61, p=0.03).
IC14 suppresses LPS-stimulated whole blood TNF production in patients with CHF and in normal subjects and therefore may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for CHF patients with systemic immune activation."

Pre-eclampsia is not associated with changes in the levels of regulatory T cells in peripheral blood.	"The acceptance of the semi-allogeneic fetus within the maternal environment requires tolerance mechanisms not fully characterized yet. Normal pregnancy is known to be associated with a Th2 profile. Furthermore, regulatory T cells (Tregs) were proposed to regulate the Th2/Th1 balance at early stages of pregnancy. Treg may avoid the shift to a Th1 profile, thus preventing miscarriage. Accordingly, spontaneous abortion is characterized by a Th1 dominance and diminished levels of Treg. The major aim of the present work was to investigate if pre-eclampsia, a late immunological complication of pregnancy, is characterized by similar hallmarks.
We measured the surface antigens CD4, CD25, CD8 and CTLA4 in peripheral blood from patients suffering from pre-eclampsia (n = 8) and age-matched patients undergoing normal pregnancies (n = 9) by four-color flow cytometry.
We were not able to find any significant differences in the levels of CD4(+), CD25(+), CD8(+), CTLA4, CD4(+)/CD25(+), CD4(+)/CD25(bright), CD4(+)/CTLA4, CD25(+)/CTLA4, CD4(+)/CD25(+)/CTLA4, CD8(+)/CD25(+), CD8(+)/CTLA4 or CD8(+)/CD25(+)/CTLA4 cell subsets.

Effect of anti-CD 20 antibody rituximab in patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).	Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a life-threatening complication following solid organ transplantation. Treatment with rituximab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has proved to be a promising approach and shown a low toxicity profile. Between February 1999 and April 2002, we conducted a multicentre phase II trial investigating rituximab as single agent in 17 patients with PTLD. Transplanted organs were heart (n = 5), kidney (n = 4), lung (n = 4) and liver (n = 4). Patients were treated with four weekly doses of 375 mg/m(2) of rituximab. The mean follow-up time is 24.2 months. Histology was distributed in 10 diffuse large cell-, 2 marginal zone-, 1 Burkitt-like lymphoma, 1 Hodgkin-like PTLD and 3 polymorphic lymphoproliferations. Therapy was well tolerated and no severe adverse events were observed. The mean overall survival period is 37.0 months with 11 patients still living. In total, 9 patients (52.9%) achieved a complete remission, with a mean duration of 17.8 months. Partial remission was observed in 1 patient, minor remission in 2 patients, no change in 3 patients and 1 patient experienced progressive disease. Two patients relapsed, at intervals 3 and 5 months after obtaining complete remission. Rituximab proved to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of PTLD.

The dying stem cell hypothesis: immune modulation as a novel mechanism for progenitor cell therapy in cardiac muscle.	Stem cell transplantation after myocardial infarction has been claimed to restore cardiac function, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. A minority of transplanted cells become adherent in heart tissue and contribute to neovascularization, whereas many donor cells die from apoptosis. We propose that apoptosis of transplanted cells modulates local tissue reactions. Apoptotic cells impact on immune reactivity by down-regulating innate and adaptive immunity, deactivating macrophages and dendritic cells, and stimulating regulatory T cells. This leads to reduced scar formation, repressed myocardial apoptosis, and improved cardiac outcome.

The use of gene therapy tools in reproductive immunology research.	Mammalian pregnancy is a complex phenomenon allowing the maternal immune system to support its allogeneic fetus, while still being effective against pathogens. Gene therapy approaches have the potential to treat devastating inherited diseases for which there is a little hope of finding a conventional cure. In reproductive medicine, experimental trials have been made so far only for correcting gene defects in utero. The use of gene therapy for improving pregnancy-rate success or avoiding pregnancy-related diseases i.e. miscarriage or pre-eclampsia, remains a very distant goal with unresolved moral and ethical aspects. However, gene therapy may help determining the role of several genes in supporting fetal growth and/or avoiding its rejection experimentally and might further help to identify new targets of intervention. Gene therapy strategies to avoid fetal rejection may include the transfer and expression of cyto-protective molecules locally at the fetal-placental interface. In addition, the ex-vivo genetic modification of immune cells for tolerance induction is a novel and tempting approach. In this regard, we have confirmed the role of the cyto-protective and immunomodulatory molecule Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), by treating animals undergoing abortion with an adenovirus coding for HO-1. Since the sole application of a control vector did not provoke deleterious effects in pregnancy outcome, we propose the use of experimental gene therapy for unveiling molecular and cellular pathways leading to pregnancy success.

Monitoring temporary immunodepression by flow cytometric measurement of monocytic HLA-DR expression: a multicenter standardized study.	"Single-center trials have shown that monocytic HLA-DR is a good marker for monitoring the severity of temporary immunodepression after trauma, major surgery, or sepsis. A new test for measuring monocytic HLA-DR is now available.
We evaluated a new test reagent set for monocytic HLA-DR expression (BD Quantibritetrade mark HLA-DR/Monocyte reagent; Becton Dickinson) in single-laboratory and interlaboratory experiments, assessing preanalytical handling, lyse-no-wash (LNW) vs lyse-wash (LW) values, reference values, and the effect of use of different flow cytometers and different instrument settings on test variance.
For preanalytical handling, EDTA anticoagulation, storage on ice as soon as possible, and staining within 4 h after blood collection gave results comparable to values obtained for samples analyzed immediately after collection (mean increase of approximately 4% in monocytic HLA-DR). Comparison of LNW and LW revealed slightly higher results for LNW ( approximately 18% higher for LNW compared with LW; r = 0.982). Comparison of different flow cytometers and instrument settings gave CVs <4%, demonstrating the independence of the test from these variables and suggesting that this method qualifies as a standardized test. CV values from the interlaboratory comparison ranged from 15% (blood sample unprocessed before transport) to 25% (stained and fixed before transport).
For the BD Quantibrite HLA-DR/Monocyte test, preanalytical handling is standardized. Single-laboratory results demonstrated the independence of this test from flow cytometer and instrument settings. Interlaboratory results showed greater variance than single-laboratory values. This interlaboratory variance was partly attributable to the influence of transport and can be reduced by optimization of transport conditions."

Protection from abortion by heme oxygenase-1 up-regulation is associated with increased levels of Bag-1 and neuropilin-1 at the fetal-maternal interface.	Tolerance mechanisms allowing pregnancy success resemble those involved in allograft acceptance. Heme oxygenase (HO) is a tissue-protective molecule, which allows graft acceptance and is known to have antiapoptotic effects on several cell types. We previously reported down-regulated levels of HO-1 and HO-2 in placenta from allopregnant mice undergoing abortion. In this study, we analyzed whether the up-regulation of HO-1 by cobalt-protoporphyrin (Co-PP) during implantation window can rescue mice from abortion. Induction of HO-1 by Co-PP treatment prevented fetal rejection, whereas the down-regulation of HOs by zinc-protoporphyrin application boosted abortion. The beneficial effect of HO-1 induction was not related to a local shift to Th2-profile or to a change in the NO system. Interestingly, the expression of the antiapoptotic/cytoprotective molecule Bag-1 as well as the levels of neuropilin-1, a novel marker for T regulatory cells, were up-regulated after Co-PP treatment. Our data strongly support a very important role for HO-1 in fetal allotolerance and suggest that HO-1 might be protective by up-regulating tissue protective molecules, i.e., Bag-1, and by activating T regulatory cells rather than by changing the local cytokine profile.

Cellular endotoxin desensitization in patients with severe chronic heart failure.	"Increased levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have been demonstrated in chronic heart failure (CHF). LPS can induce cellular desensitization, with specific down-regulation of LPS-mediated cellular tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production which does not affect other cytokine parameters. It is not known if LPS desensitization occurs in CHF.
Mononuclear cells from 24 CHF patients (mean age 70+/-2 years, age range 58 to 78 years, NYHA class 3.0+/-0.2) and 11 healthy controls (mean age 53+/-3 years, age range 39 to 75 years) were separated from venous blood and cultured for 24 h with LPS (E. coli, 0-10 ng/mL). Culture supernatants were tested for TNF-alpha and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Patients were subgrouped into mild (n=10), moderate (n=5), and severe (n=9) CHF. Independently of age, mononuclear cells from patients with severe heart failure produced less TNF-alpha than controls (p<0.05) and patients with mild (p<0.001) or moderate CHF (p<0.05). IL-1RA release was higher for CHF patients as a group, compared with controls (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in IL-1RA release between CHF patient subgroups.
Mononuclear cells from patients with severe heart failure produce significantly less TNF-alpha than healthy controls or patients with mild to moderate disease. Production of IL-1RA is not affected.

The effect of micronutrient supplementation on quality-of-life and left ventricular function in elderly patients with chronic heart failure.	"Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common and leading cause of death in industrialized countries. The potential benefits of micronutrient supplementation in CHF are extensive. Therefore, we examined the influence of long-term multiple micronutrient supplementation on left ventricular (LV) function, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and quality-of-life (QoL) in elderly patients with CHF.
Thirty CHF patients [age 75.4 (0.7), mean (SEM), LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =35%] were randomized to receive capsules containing a combination of high-dose micronutrients (calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, selenium, vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, vitamin B(6), folate, vitamin B(12), vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, and Coenzyme Q10) or placebo for 9 months in a double-blind fashion. All subjects were on stable optimal medical therapy for at least 3 months before enrolment. At randomization and at study end, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and its soluble receptors TNFR-1 and TNFR-2 were measured and six-minute walk test and QoL were assessed. Cardiac magnetic resonance scanning was performed to evaluate cardiac dimensions and LVEF. Two patients died during follow-up. The remaining patients (14 randomized to placebo and 14 to micronutrients) were well matched for LV function, symptoms, and exercise capacity. At the end of the follow-up period, LV volumes were reduced in the intervention group with no change in the placebo group [-13.1 (17.1)% vs. +3.8 (10.0)%; P<0.05]. LVEF increased by 5.3+/-1.4% in the intervention group and was unchanged in the placebo group (P<0.05). Patients taking micronutrients also had a significant improvement in QoL score between enrolment and study end [+9.5 (1.6)%; P<0.05], whereas those taking placebo had a slight deterioration [-1.1 (0.8)%; P=0.12]. Six-minute walk test and inflammatory cytokine levels remained unchanged in both groups.

Upregulation of Bcl-2 at the foetal-maternal interface from mice undergoing abortion.	Several burning questions remain unanswered in pregnancy-related research. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines orchestrate an intriguing interaction leading either to the development of a normal individual or to its rejection. Augmented Th1 cytokines' production is involved in immunological rejection of the foetus. Excessive production of Th1 cytokines, particularly of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, also triggers apoptosis. Thus, in the present work we investigated the incidence of apoptosis in a well-known experimental model of Th1-induced abortion, characterized by increased local TNF-alpha levels. Apoptosis of lymphocytes as well as their Th1 and Th2 cytokine production were analysed by flow cytometry. TNF-alpha mRNA levels were additionally analysed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in placental and decidual samples. Total placental apoptosis activity was investigated by measuring caspase-3 activity and by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end label staining. Immunohistochemistry, Western blot and real time RT-PCR were used to localize and quantify several anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules at the foetal-maternal interface. Despite elevated Th1 levels at the foetal-maternal interface, mice undergoing abortion presented comparable apoptotic rates. Interestingly, we found a significant upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein at the foetal-maternal interface from abortion-prone mice, while no changes could be observed for pro-apoptotic molecules. In the light of our results, we conclude that there is no evidence of increased apoptosis in mice undergoing immunological abortion in spite of elevated TNF-alpha levels. This is probably due to a selective upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathways (i.e. Bcl-2) at the foetal-maternal interface as a compensatory and/or protective mechanism.

CD31+ naïve Th cells are stable during six months following kidney transplantation: implications for post-transplant thymic function.	Little is known about thymus function in transplant patients. Until recently, the phenotype of T cells that recently emigrated the thymus was unknown. Now it has been demonstrated that CD4(+) recent thymus emigrants coexpress CD31 and CD45RA. Here, we investigated whether uremia and immunosuppression influence CD31(+) CD45RA(+) Th cells before and after kidney transplantation, respectively. Forty-eight renal transplant patients were included receiving either standard triple/quadruple (n = 35) immunosuppression, OKT-3 induction (n = 7) or FTY-720 (n = 6), respectively. Peripheral CD31(+) CD45RA(+) Th cells were quantified flowcytometrically before and at week 1, 4, 12 and 24 post-transplantation. Thirty-nine healthy adults served as controls. CD31(+) CD45RA(+) Th cells correlated inversely with age in patients and controls and were comparable in patients before transplantation and age-matched controls. Importantly, CD31(+) CD45RA(+) Th cell frequencies remained stable during 6 months post-transplantation. In conclusion, CD31(+) CD45RA(+) Th cells are not significantly altered by uremia before and during 6 months of immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation. Implications for thymus function are discussed.

Whole blood endotoxin responsiveness in patients with chronic heart failure: the importance of serum lipoproteins.	"Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] may be an important stimulus for cytokine release in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). We sought to investigate the relationship between whole blood endotoxin responsiveness and serum lipoprotein concentrations. It is not known if low-dose LPS is sufficient to stimulate immune activation.
Whole blood from 32 CHF patients (mean age 66+/-2 years, NYHA class 2.7+/-0.2, five female) and 11 healthy control subjects (mean age 47+/-4 years, six female) was stimulated with LPS at nine different concentrations (0.001 to 10 ng/mL), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) release was quantified. Reference standard endotoxin at concentrations of 0, 0.6, 1, and 3 EU/ml was added to whole blood from nine CHF patients (age 64+/-9.1 years, all NYHA class II, eight male) and incubated for 6 h, the TNF-alpha production being measured. Serum lipoproteins were quantified using standard techniques. In CHF patients, there was an inverse relationship between whole blood TNF-alpha release and serum cholesterol which was strongest at 0.6 ng/mL of LPS (r=-0.53, p=0.002). A similar although weaker relationship was found for serum HDL. No such correlation was found in healthy subjects or with serum LDL (all r(2)<0.1). Low concentrations of LPS induced a stepwise increase in TNF-alpha release from whole blood to concentrations well above those seen in CHF.
Serum lipoproteins may play an important role in regulating LPS bioactivity in CHF. Very low LPS activity, at levels seen in vivo in CHF, can induce significant TNF-alpha production ex vivo."

HLA type-independent generation of antigen-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy.	Adoptive immunotherapy with antigen-specific T cells has been successfully used to treat certain infectious diseases and cancers. Although more patients may profit from T cell therapy, its more frequent use is restricted by limitations in current T cell generation strategies. The most commonly applied peptide-based approaches rely on the knowledge of relevant epitopes. Therefore, T cells cannot be generated for diseases with unknown epitopes or for patients with unfavorable HLA types. We developed a peptide-based approach for HLA type-independent generation of specific T cells against various proteins. It is based on short-time stimulation with peptide libraries that cover most CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell epitopes of given proteins. The procedure requires no prior knowledge of epitopes because libraries are synthesized solely on the basis of the protein's amino acid sequence. Stimulation is followed by immunomagnetic selection of activated IFN-gamma-secreting cells and nonspecific expansion. To evaluate the protocol, we generated autologous T cells specific for a well-characterized antigen, the human cytomegalovirus phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). Generated T cell lines consisted of pp65-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes that displayed antigen-specific killing and proliferation. The protocol combines the biosafety of peptide-based approaches with HLA type independence and may help to advance adoptive immunotherapy in the future.

Release of the mitochondrial enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase under septic conditions.	To identify sepsis-related dysregulations of protein expression in the liver, we used a baboon model of acute endotoxemia and performed comparative proteome analysis. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was followed by an early but long-lasting (5-48 h) generation of N-terminal fragments of carbamoyl phosphate synthase-1 (CPS-1), an abundant enzyme of the hepatic urea cycle, which is normally located in the mitochondrial matrix. In addition, we developed a new sandwich immunoassay to determine circulating CPS-1 in human and baboons. We found CPS-1 to be induced by LPS and to be released into the circulation of healthy humans and baboons as early as 4 to 5 h after stimulation. Similarly, CPS-1 levels increased after injection of gram-positive bacteria in another baboon model. Enhanced CPS-1 levels were also detected in serum of patients with sepsis. Our data demonstrate fragmentation of CPS-1 in the liver and early increase in circulating CPS-1 levels under septic conditions. We suggest that circulating CPS-1 might serve as a novel serum marker indicating mitochondrial impairment of the liver and/or the small intestine in critically ill patients.

The expression of legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase that controls antigen processing, is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant monocytes.	The exposition of monocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) primarily causes a massive inflammatory response that is then followed by a hyporesponsive state of these cells. This latter state is called endotoxin tolerance and is characterized by (i) the attenuated production of proinflammatory mediators after repeated LPS treatment, and (ii) the diminished antigen presentation and T-cell stimulation capacity. The data presented here indicate that LPS priming causes a specific decrease in the expression of legumain (the asparaginyl endopeptidase responsible for the key step in antigen processing) in monocytes. In these cells, the fraction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II loaded with CLIP was increased. In contrast to monocytes, LPS priming provoked an increase of legumain expression in B cells. Reduced monocytic expression of legumain was also found in critically ill patients supporting the suitability of endotoxin tolerance as an experimental model of clinical postinflammatory immunodeficiency.

Probiotic therapy in the prevention of pouchitis onset: decreased interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and interferon-gamma gene expression.	"Probiotic therapy has been shown to prevent the onset of pouchitis and to improve the quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients who required ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Pouchitis has been associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
In this retrospective analysis of archived endoscopic samples from responding patients enrolled in the above-mentioned trial, we were interested in studying mucosal gene expression of the pleiotropic proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6), TH1 cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-12), regulatory cytokines (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor-beta), and the chemokine interleukin-8. In addition to assessment of cytokine gene expression, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the mucosal tissue was evaluated.
Data show that patients who were treated with probiotics had significant lower mucosal mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, and interferon-gamma compared with placebo-treated patients. In addition, a lower number of polymorphonuclear cells was present in the tissue of patients within the probiotic group compared with the number of polymorphonuclear cells in the tissue of patients receiving placebo and patients having an episode of pouchitis.
These data suggest that probiotic treatment regulates the mucosal immune response by reducing mucosal levels of neutrophil-chemoattractant IL-8 and tissue influx of polymorphonuclear cells, and may further act by inhibition of T-cell activation, by reinforcement of barrier function and by a tight control of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta."

Effect of cytokines and chemokines (TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, RANTES) gene polymorphisms in kidney recipients on posttransplantation outcome: influence of donor-recipient match.	Posttransplantation alloantigen-dependent and alloantigen-independent processes are both mediated by cytokines and chemokines. Recently cytokines and chemokines, as well as their receptors, have been shown to be highly polymorphic. The cytokine and chemokine gene polymorphisms are associated with variable production, activity, expression, or ligand-receptor affinity. The aim of our study was to analyze the relation between selected cytokine and chemokine gene polymorphisms in kidney donors and recipients as a function of donor-recipient match and posttransplantation outcome. Polymorphisms transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta); tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha); interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1); and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) genes were determined using DNA polymerase chain reaction technology in 268 healthy volunteers, 345 kidney transplant recipients (1997 to 1999), and 298 cadaveric donors. Patients were followed up for 4 to 6 years. The distribution of alleles of selected genes was identical in control subjects, cadaveric donors, and recipients. Low TGF-beta production in both the donor and recipient genotypes was associated with risk for early rejection (6 months) and worse graft function at 4 years. The only tendency for worse graft outcome was observed among donor-recipient combinations mismatched for TGF-beta genotype. Genetic determination of TNF-alpha and IL-10 production was associated with delayed graft function and rejection. IL-6 gene polymorphisms had no effect on the incidence of early acute rejections, but was associated with worse 5-year outcomes. Determinations of MCP-1 overproduction and RANTES-109 TT allele were associated with significant deterioration of graft function. Our data support the hypothesis that the strength of the alloimmune response after transplantation is in part genetically determined. Donor-recipient matching of cytokine gene polymorphisms has a marginal effect.

Cytokines and chemokine gene expression in human kidney transplantation.	Despite advances in immunosuppression in past decades, allograft rejection remains the main reason for kidney graft failure. Recently, despite great improvements in understanding of molecular basis of allograft rejections, renal histology remains the primary method to monitor the onset of graft rejection. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether cytokine and chemokine expression profiles in kidney allografts contributed to the diagnosis of graft dysfunction. We analyzed mRNA expression in 174 kidney graft biopsies for the following cytokines: TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, IL-10, and chemokine RANTES. Based on the expression levels obtained by real-time RT-PCR, we correlated data with the results of morphologic examinations. All tested cytokines and chemokines were upregulated (P < .001) during acute rejection compared to nonrejecting controls. Upregulation was also found in chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) group for TGF-beta1, IL-10 (P < .001), TNF-alpha, and RANTES (P < .01). Upregulated expression of IL-10 (P < .001), TGF-beta1, (P < .01) and RANTES (P < .05) showed borderline changes. Higher expression levels (P < .001) of TGF-beta1 and IL-10 were also found during ATN. IL-10 was upregulated (P < .01) in specimens with recurrent glomerulonephritis. Weakly increased (P < .05) expressions of TGF-beta1 were found during CsA toxicity. Distinctive expression levels between acute rejection and CAN were only found for IL-10 (P < .01). TNF-alpha showed a different expression profile in acute rejection versus ATN (P < .001). These findings suggest that distinct cytokine and chemokine expression profiles in grafts may contribute to the diagnosis for and elucidation of the immunopathologic process during graft dysfunction.

Accurate prediction of kidney allograft outcome based on creatinine course in the first 6 months posttransplant.	Most attempts to predict early kidney allograft loss are based on the patient and donor characteristics at baseline. We investigated how the early posttransplant creatinine course compares to baseline information in the prediction of kidney graft failure within the first 4 years after transplantation. Two approaches to create a prediction rule for early graft failure were evaluated. First, the whole data set was analysed using a decision-tree building software. The software, rpart, builds classification or regression models; the resulting models can be represented as binary trees. In the second approach, a Hill-Climbing algorithm was applied to define cut-off values for the median creatinine level and creatinine slope in the period between day 60 and 180 after transplantation. Of the 497 patients available for analysis, 52 (10.5%) experienced an early graft loss (graft loss within the first 4 years after transplantation). From the rpart algorithm, a single decision criterion emerged: Median creatinine value on days 60 to 180 higher than 3.1 mg/dL predicts early graft failure (accuracy 95.2% but sensitivity = 42.3%). In contrast, the Hill-Climbing algorithm delivered a cut-off of 1.8 mg/dL for the median creatinine level and a cut-off of 0.3 mg/dL per month for the creatinine slope (sensitivity = 69.5% and specificity 79.0%). Prediction rules based on median and slope of creatinine levels in the first half year after transplantation allow early identification of patients who are at risk of loosing their graft early after transplantation. These patients may benefit from therapeutic measures tailored for this high-risk setting.

Natriuretic peptides and E-selectin as predictors of acute deterioration in patients with inotrope-dependent heart failure.	"In patients with inotrope-dependent end-stage heart failure the timely application of the most suitable treatment, i.e. heart transplantation, implantation of a ventricular assist device or conservative treatment, is a key issue for therapeutic success.
Seventy-six inotrope-dependent patients with end-stage heart failure were enrolled. Measurements of hemodynamics, routine laboratory parameters, and clinical examination were performed daily. Additionally, natriuretic peptides (BNP and NT-proBNP) and E-selectin were measured at the end of the study. The patients were retrospectively divided into groups with regard to the following end-points: Group I-deterioration into cardiogenic shock after an initially stable clinical course (n=26); Group II-stable clinical course without deterioration into cardiogenic (n=41); Group III-weaning from inotropic support (n=9).
One day before cardiogenic shock occurred, BNP, NT-proBNP and E-selectin were significantly elevated in group I compared with group II. A logistic regression model showed that only BNP and E-selectin were independent predictors of clinical deterioration on the following day. The odds ratio (OR) for E-selectin using a cut-off point of 65ng/ml was 8.7 and for BNP using a cut-off of 500pg/ml it was 4.8. In combination, the OR increased to 11.1. Continuous decrease of NT-proBNP predicted patients in whom weaning from inotropes was possible.
While routine parameters did not predict the clinical course, elevated BNP and E-selectin independently predicted cardiogenic shock on admission and 1 day before its occurrence. The combination showed increased predictive value."

Significant reduction of proinflammatory cytokines by treatment of the brain-dead donor.	"Experimental studies suggest that brain death in the donor has a significant impact on graft quality; however, there are no data correlating organ-specific cytokine expression and the corresponding serum protein levels in human organ donors. Furthermore, it is unknown whether donor treatment can reduce the up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and thereby optimize organ quality.
We investigated the expression pattern of cytokines comparing serum (n = 53) and tissue expression (n = 25) in brain-dead human donors. The controls were living donors (n = 25). Additionally 41 deceased donors were treated with steroids before organ harvest (250 mg initial, afterward 100 mg/h until laparotomy). Hepatic tissue samples were obtained immediately after donor laparotomy to assess transcription rates of tissue cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, CD3, TGFb, TNFa, BAG, HO-1, Mipla) by RT-PCR. Serum samples were obtained after declaration of brain death and before laparotomy.
Transcription of proinflammatory cytokines was significantly increased in brain-dead compared to living donor grafts (P < .005). Donor treatment with steroids led to significantly decreased tissue and serum expression of proinflammatory cytokines (P < .01), which were comparable to living donors. Tissue levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) correlated strongly with serum levels of the corresponding proteins.
Serum protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines proffer a valuable, easy accessible marker to define the immunological status of a graft. Our data suggest a beneficial effect of anti-inflammatory treatment of brain-dead organ donors."

Induction of heme oxygenase-1 in the donor reduces graft immunogenicity.	There is increasing evidence that the induction of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) improves both graft function and survival. Although it has been shown that HO-1 promotes graft protection, it remains unknown whether it reduces graft immunogenicity by modulating dendritic cells. In the current experiment, we investigated the impact of HO-1 induction on frequencies and trafficking of donor-derived dendritic cells (DCs). Kidneys from DA rats were transplanted into untreated Lewis recipients. Donor animals were treated with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP; 5 mg/kg IP) 24 hours prior to organ harvesting to induce HO-1. Controls remained untreated or received zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP; 20 mg/kg, IP) to block HO-1 induction. Analyses of grafts, spleens, lymph nodes and blood of Lewis recipients were performed at days 1 and 3 posttransplantation. Donor-specific DCs were determined by flow cytometry using haplotype-specific mAb against RT1(ab) and mAb against OX62(+) antigens. Cell markers (CD4/CD8(+) T cells, ED1(+) monocytes, MHC class II(+) CD86(+) DC) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. T-cell alloreactivity of recipient splenocytes was measured by ELISPOT. Induction of HO-1 reduced frequencies of donor-derived DCs in the graft and recipient compartments, which was associated with reduced frequencies of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells and alloreactivity. Expression of costimulatory molecule CD86 and MHC class II antigens were also reduced, although not significantly. Thus, induction of HO-1 reduced graft immunogenicity. These mechanisms may explain the protective effects of HO-1 induction.

Induction of carbon monoxide in the donor reduces graft immunogenicity and chronic graft deterioration.	Chronic allograft dysfunction remains the major obstacle for long-term successful transplantation. To date there is no effective treatment. Overexpression of protective genes has provided increased graft function and survival. This mechanism has been implicated in the process of graft accommodation. One of these genes that has been shown to mediate protective effects decodes the enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and an HO-1 downstream product, carbon monoxide (CO). Using an established model of kidney chronic allograft rejection in the rat, we investigated the impact of methylene chloride (MC), a CO donor, as a therapeutic tool to reduce chronic graft deterioration. We showed that donor and long-term recipient treatment with MC improved graft function and reduced histological signs of chronic rejection. Carbon monoxide may be a promising agent to improve graft quality and long-term graft function.

Quantification of donor-derived DNA in serum: a new approach of acute rejection diagnosis in a rat kidney transplantation model.	Clinical and laboratory findings of acute rejection (AR) are often late and misleading. Core needle biopsy, the most reliable diagnostic method, is usually performed late in the course of AR and is associated with several complications. Therefore noninvasive approaches to monitor the immune system for detection of early AR is one of the major aims in transplant medicine. In a fully MHC-mismatched renal allograft model in the rat, we quantified donor-derived DNA (ddDNA) in the recipient serum using real-time RT-PCR as an alternative screening procedure for the early diagnosis of acute rejection. We also investigated the influence of different immunosuppressive protocols on the levels of ddDNA. Our results show that donor-derived DNA is present in the serum of kidney allograft recipients prior to acute rejection. Animals that received a syngeneic graft and animals that received a mismatched allograft but were treated with immunosuppressive drugs did not show significant elevations of ddDNA. When steroid therapy failed to avoid acute rejection, the animals showed a delayed peak of ddDNA. In summary, the detection of ddDNA in recipient serum offers a noninvasive diagnostic approach to uncover ongoing rejection processes in the graft.

Protection from cytomegalovirus after transplantation is correlated with immediate early 1-specific CD8 T cells.	T cells are crucial for the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in infected individuals. Although CMV-specific T cells can be quantified by various methods, clear correlates of protection from CMV disease have not been defined. However, responses to the pp65 protein are believed to play an important role. Here, the proportions of interferon gamma-producing T cells following ex vivo activation with pools of overlapping peptides representing the pp65 and immediate early (IE)-1 proteins were determined at multiple time points and related to the development of CMV disease in 27 heart and lung transplant recipients. Frequencies of IE-1-specific CD8 T cells above 0.2 and 0.4% at day 0 and 2 wk, respectively, or 0.4% at any time during the first months discriminated patients who did not develop CMV disease from patients at risk, 50-60% of whom developed CMV disease. No similar distinction between risk groups was possible based on pp65-specific CD8 or CD4 T cell responses. Remarkably, CMV disease developed exclusively in patients with a dominant pp65-specific CD8 T cell response. In conclusion, high frequencies of IE-1 but not pp65-specific CD8 T cells correlate with protection from CMV disease. These results have important implications for monitoring T cell responses, adoptive cell therapy, and vaccine design.

Abnormal T-cell reactivity against paternal antigens in spontaneous abortion: adoptive transfer of pregnancy-induced CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells prevents fetal rejection in a murine abortion model.	Mammalian pregnancy is thought to be a state of immunological tolerance. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still poorly understood. Here, we determined whether an inappropriate function of T regulatory (Treg) cells is involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous abortion. We evaluated spleen and decidual lymphocytes from CBA/J mice undergoing immunological abortion (DBA/2J-mated) or having normal pregnancy (BALB/c-mated) on day 14 of gestation for ex vivo cytokine production after PMA or paternal antigen (alloantigen) stimulation. Treg activity was characterized by quantifying CD4(+)CD25(+) cells, foxp3 expression, and interleukin-10 secretion. Decidual lymphocytes from abortion CBA/J mice contained a significantly higher frequency of interferon-gamma-producing T cells specific for paternal antigens compared to those from normal pregnancy (7.8% versus 2.7%, P < 0.05). Compared to virgin CBA/J females, normal pregnant mice showed strongly elevated numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) and interleukin-10(+) Treg cells in the thymus whereas significantly lower frequencies of Treg cells were observed in abortion mice. Very interestingly, CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells from normal pregnant and nonpregnant CBA/J mice could inhibit both proliferation and interferon-gamma secretion of lymphocytes from abortion mice in vitro whereas in vivo prevention of fetal rejection could only be achieved after adoptive transfer of Treg cells from normal pregnant mice. Our data suggest that pregnancy-induced Treg cells play a vital role in maternal tolerance to the allogeneic fetus.

Up-regulation of HIF in experimental acute renal failure: evidence for a protective transcriptional response to hypoxia.	"Medullary hypoxia is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute renal failure (ARF). Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) are recognized as master regulators of hypoxic adaptation, but little is known about their role in renal disease.
A multi-insult rat model of ARF combining the application of contrast medium with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition was used to study chronology and distribution of the oxygen regulated HIF isoforms HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in comparison with the hypoxia-marker pimonidazole between 10 minutes and 48 hours after injury induction. Treatment with furosemide was used to study HIF expression under conditions of ameliorated tissue injury.
Contrast medium in combination with NOS and COX inhibition resulted in widespread induction of HIF in the outer and inner medulla that was initiated within 10 minutes, reached the highest levels at 2 hours and diminished 8 hours to 24 hours thereafter. HIF isoforms were expressed in a cell type-specific fashion: HIF-1alpha in tubular and HIF-2alpha in interstitial and endothelial cells. The degree of HIF-1alpha accumulation varied between nephron segments, being much stronger in collecting ducts than in medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (mTAL). Comparison with pimonidazole staining and the effect of furosemide indicated that HIF induction in mTAL is maximal with moderate hypoxia and declines with increasing severity of hypoxia.
A complex pattern of HIF activation appears to play an important role in tissue preservation as a response to regional renal hypoxia. The limited capacity of mTAL cells for HIF activation may explain their susceptibility to injury."

Allo-specific T-cells encoding for viral IL-10 exert strong immunomodulatory effects in vitro but fail to prevent graft rejection.	Recently, we demonstrated the capacity of allo-specific gene-engineered T lymphocytes as transport vehicle for therapeutic transgenes into allografts. In this study, the influence of viral IL-10 as therapeutic transgene was addressed. Lewis rat T-cell lines specific for DA rat alloantigens were engineered to express vIL-10 by using a retroviral gene expression system. Like T regulatory 1 cells, vIL-10 transgenic T lymphocytes express the phenotype CD4(+)25(+) and secrete, in addition to vIL-10, rat IL-10 and IFN-gamma but no IL-4. First, the capacity of vIL-10 transgenic T-cell lines to modulate alloantigen-specific immune responses was evaluated in vitro. In comparison to control MLR with no transgenic cells or equal numbers of control T(EGFP)-lymphocytes, the proliferation as well as production of IFN-gamma by naive responder cells were significantly diminished. Despite this regulatory capacity in vitro, T(vIL-10)-lymphocytes were not able, either alone or in combination with suboptimal doses of Cyclosporine A, to prolong the survival of either DA rat cardiac or renal allografts in Lewis rat recipients. These data demonstrate that intra-graft IL-10 over-expression is not sufficient to prolong allograft survival in a high-responder strain combination and that the regulatory capacity of T cells in vitro does not predict their in vivo efficiency.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a common phenomenon in kidney transplant patients that might be a prestage of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Because the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) for PTLD development is well established, we wondered about the association between EBV and MGUS. Thus, B-cells from kidney transplant patients (25 with and 100 without MGUS) and from 100 healthy controls were analyzed for EBV latent (EBER1) and lytic (EA, VCA) gene expression by RT-nested PCR. The EBV load was measured by real-time PCR. A significantly higher EBV load and expression of the nonimmunogenic latency associated EBER 1 gene was observed in patients with MGUS compared to both control groups (P < .001). In addition, a rare detection of the highly immunogenic lytic transcripts demonstrated a linkage between latency-associated EBV infection and MGUS in transplant patients. This pattern was similar to EBV-associated B-cell lymphomas in nonimmunosuppressed patients. It contrasted with PTLD patients who express higher EBV loads and both lytic and latent EBV transcripts. These data suggest that transplant patients with MGUS demonstrate a more sufficient control of EBV-infected B-cells. Nevertheless, EBV monitoring should be performed in patients with EBV-associated MGUS for early detection of later PTLD.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay for donor-reactive interferon-gamma-producing cells identifies T-cell presensitization and correlates with graft function at 6 and 12 months in renal-transplant recipients.	"A major goal in clinical transplantation is the individualization of immunosuppression. This requires a definition of markers that identify patients at heightened risk of acute rejection and immune-mediated chronic allograft nephropathy.
Frequencies of interferon-gamma-producing donor-reactive cells were serially determined in unselected renal-transplant patients in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) before transplantation (n = 42) and up to 10 (mean 5.0) times during the first 6 months posttransplantation (n = 48) to determine detailed kinetics and analyze for correlation with acute rejection and graft function at 6 and 12 months posttransplantation.
Pretransplant ELISPOT frequencies were significantly higher in patients with acute rejection (16/42) versus nonrejecters (26/42). Highly elevated pretransplant frequencies (>200 spots/300,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs], n = 5/42) were associated with a risk of severe acute rejection episodes but were independent of risk factors such as high panel reactive antibodies. Early graft failure exclusively occurred in this group. Importantly, mean ELISPOT frequencies at weeks 2 and 3 but not at month 6 posttransplant correlated inversely with 6 and 12 months glomerular filtration rate. The correlation between ELISPOT frequencies and renal function showed the highest significance in patients without acute rejection.
The pretransplant ELISPOT assay might be useful to identify T-cell presensitized patients, who are at heightened risk for severe early acute rejection. An analysis of ELISPOT donor-reactive cells during the early posttransplant period might allow an identification of patients at risk for immune-mediated graft deterioration."

Heme oxygenase as a therapeutic target in immunological pregnancy complications.	The allogeneic fetus has been considered to be an allograft and the tolerance mechanisms involved in pregnancy maintenance resemble those leading to graft acceptance. Up-regulation of Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) promotes graft acceptance. Additionally, HO-1 has been proposed to have tissue-protective properties. Previous studies reported the presence of HO-1 and HO-2 in mammalian placenta and postulated a protective role for HO during pregnancy. Here, we analyze HO-1 and HO-2 expression at the feto-maternal interface from normal pregnant and abortion mice and correlate these findings with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression as well as with Th1/Th2 cytokine production by immune cells. DBA/2-mated CBA/J females undergoing abortion and BALB/c-mated CBA/J females having normal pregnancies were included in our study. The mice received no treatment. On day 14 of pregnancy, the mice were sacrificed, the abortion rate was calculated and the ex vivo Th1/Th2 production by decidual immune cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of HO-1 and HO-2, iNOS and eNOS was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot in placenta samples. The Th1/Th2 cytokines ratio was augmented in decidua from abortion mice. We further observed a significant down-regulation of HO-1, HO-2, iNOS and eNOS molecules in placental tissue from mice undergoing abortion when compared to normal pregnant mice. Since we found diminished HOs and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels at the feto-maternal interface from abortion mice when compared to normal pregnant mice, which were further associated with increased Th1/Th2 cytokine production, we propose HO as a putative therapeutic target in immunological abortions. Up-regulation of HO-1 or HO-2 would favour the Th2-cytokine production, which could avoid abortion onset.

Comparison of adefovir and tenofovir in the treatment of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus infection.	Adefovir dipivoxil was recently approved for the treatment of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a congender of adefovir that is used in the treatment of HIV infected patients, has recently been shown to also be effective in patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection. We therefore compared the two substances in a study of 53 patients defined by high HBV DNA (>6 log10 copies/mL) levels and genotypic evidence of lamivudine resistance. Thirty-five patients received tenofovir for 72 to 130 weeks, and 18 received adefovir for 60 to 80 weeks. Changes in HBV DNA levels were followed for the complete period of 48 weeks. Early viral kinetics were compared on matched subgroups of 5 patients each. Individually, all tenofovir-treated patients showed a strong and early suppression of HBV DNA within a few weeks whether they were coinfected with HIV or were without comorbidity. In contrast, considerable individual variations in HBV DNA decline were observed in the adefovir group. Thus at week 48, only 44% of these patients had HBV DNA levels below 10(5) copies/mL in contrast to 100% of the tenofovir-treated patients (P = .001). No severe side effects were noticed in either group. No evidence of phenotypic viral resistance could be demonstrated in the tenofovir-treated patients in the long term (up to 130 weeks). In conclusion, tenofovir may become an effective alternative for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV infection.

Is there an interaction between interleukin-10 and interleukin-22?	Interleukin(IL)-10 and IL-22 are structurally related cytokines. Their heterodimeric receptors consist of the cytokine-specific chains IL-10R1 and IL-22R1, respectively, and the common chain IL-10R2. This study focused on the question of whether IL-10 modulates IL-22 effects and vice versa. This question is important because IL-10 and IL-22 exert anti- and proinflammatory effects, respectively, and, as we show here, are simultaneously present in both systemic and local inflammation. The revealed lacking concomitance of IL-10R1 and IL-22R1 on identical cells excluded any possible interaction between IL-10 and IL-22 apart from the competition for IL-10R2. To study this competition, monocytes and hepatocytes were chosen. The dependence of the cytokine action on IL-10R2 was verified. Interestingly, no influence of IL-22 on IL-10 effects was observed. The same was true when IL-22 was used in complex with IL-22-binding protein. Similarly, no influence of IL-10 was found on IL-22 action. This missing competition seemed to be due to a lack of binding between IL-10R2 and the native cytokines in the absence of their corresponding R1 chain. However, IL-10R2 interacted with defined IL-10- and IL-22-derived peptides supporting the hypothesis that cytokine binding to its corresponding R1 chain creates a binding site on this cytokine for IL-10R2.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of myelin-reactive T cells in patients with multiple sclerosis.	Activated myelin-specific T cells are thought to mediate inflammatory tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Applying a large panel of myelin antigens, we demonstrate the direct ex vivo detection of viable IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha producing CD4+/CD69+ T cells 6 hours after antigenic challenge, by intracellular flow cytometry in 3/33 MS patients and 2/26 healthy controls with calculated frequencies of (mean +/- SEM): 0.031% +/- 0.002% versus 0.037% +/- 0.029%. By comparison, the recently developed IL-7 modified proliferation assay revealed i) a higher number of individuals showing myelin reactivity (17/37 MS patients and 12/24 healthy individuals) and ii) a significant difference in the response to myelin basic protein (MBP) between the two groups in a longitudinal analysis, indicating a higher activity of myelin-specific T cells in MS patients. Our data provide new perspectives in detecting pathogenetically relevant T cells, but clearly demonstrate the different conclusions which must be drawn from various approaches concerning the quantification of autoreactive T cells.

Brain-IL-1 beta triggers astrogliosis through induction of IL-6: inhibition by propranolol and IL-10.	"Gliosis is a characteristic pathology in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Cytokines are considered to be effectors of gliosis. It has been shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 boost glia scar formation. On the other hand, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra), can act neuroprotectively. Furthermore, various immune mediators and neurotransmitters can modulate the onset of gliosis.
We used 100 male Sprague-Dawley rats to investigate the mechanisms of brain-cytokine-induced astrogliosis using an in vivo model of convection-enhanced delivery of cytokines (IL-beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) into the cerebro-ventricular system. The protective effects of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the neurotransmitter propranolol were also investigated.
With this paradigm, we could clearly demonstrate that IL-6 is a key cytokine mediating astrogliosis, noticeable in the increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Thus intra-cerebroventricular infusion of IL-6 increased GFAP expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GFAP expression was also increased by IL-beta, which correspondingly triggered an IL-6 release into the CSF. Accordingly, TNF-alpha, which did not induce IL-6 release, also did not induce gliosis. On the other hand, substances which decrease IL-beta-induced IL-6 production, such as propranolol and IL-10, also dramatically decreased IL-beta triggered gliosis.
IL-6 infusion, as well as IL-beta-induced IL-6 release into the CSF, increase GFAP expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Accordingly, blockade of the IL-beta-induced IL-6 release by IL-10 and propranolol decreases GFAP expression."

MHC class I manipulation on cell surfaces by gene transfer of anti-MHC class I intrabodies--a tool for decreased immunogenicity of allogeneic tissue and cell transplants.	"Intrabodies (IB) are suitable tools to down-regulate the expression of cell surface molecules in general. In this work, the appearance of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules on the cell surface could be prevented by the expression of intracellularly localized anti-MHC class I antibodies. The expression of MHC antigens presenting intracellularly synthetised peptides on the cell surface is the predominant reason for immunologic detection and rejection of allogeneic cell and tissue transplants. Allogeneic keratinocyte sheets might be a suitable tool for skin grafting. Within this study primary rat keratinocytes have been transfected with anti-MHC I-IB. Strong IB-expressing cells showed a MHC I ""knockout"" phenotype. The cells did not exhibit any significant alterations compared to non-transfected cells: the cell growth and the expression of other surface molecules were unaltered. Merely an enhanced intracellular accumulation of MHC I molecules could be detected. Notably, IB-expressing keratinocytes displayed a reduced susceptibility to allogeneic cytotoxic T cells in vitro compared to unmodified cells with a normal level of MHC I surface expression. These MHC I-deficient keratinocytes might be utilized in tissue-engineered allogeneic non-immunogeneic skin transplants. The principle of MHC class I manipulation in general can be used for other allogeneic cell and tissue-engineered transplants as well."

Immunomodulatory effects of inactivated parapoxvirus ovis (ORF virus) on human peripheral immune cells: induction of cytokine secretion in monocytes and Th1-like cells.	Inactivated parapoxvirus ovis (Orf virus; PPVO) recently displayed strong immunostimulating and modulating capacities in several animal models for acute and chronic virus infections through the induction of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) as a key mediator of antiviral activity. The data presented in this work demonstrate that inactivated PPVO has strong effects on cytokine secretion by human immune cells, including the upregulation of inflammatory and Th1-related cytokines (IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-12, and IL-18) as well as anti-inflammatory and Th2-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1ra]). Studies on the mechanism of action revealed virus particles to be the effective components of the preparation. The virus particles activate monocytes or other antigen-presenting cells (APC), e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells, through signaling over CD14 and a Toll-like receptor and the intracellular presence of certain PPVO-specific components. The activation of monocytes or APC is followed by the release of early proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-8) as well as the Th1-related cytokines IL-12 and IL-18. Both IL-18 and IL-12 are involved in PPVO-mediated IFN-gamma release by T cells and/or NK cells. The proinflammatory response is accompanied by the induction of anti-inflammatory and Th2-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-1ra), which exert a limiting efffect on the inflammatory response induced by PPVO. We conclude that the induction of a natural immune response with physiologically significant amounts of different cytokines and with antiviral potential might provide advantages over existing antiviral immunotherapies.

Heat shock protein 70 in patients with chronic heart failure: relation to disease severity and survival.	"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is essential for cellular recovery, survival and maintenance of cellular function. Research into the possible use of Hsp70 as a cytoprotective therapeutic agent is ongoing. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a state associated with systemic inflammation, particularly in patients with cardiac cachexia. We hypothesised that circulating Hsp70 levels are elevated in patients with CHF, more so in cachechtic patients, and that Hsp70 levels would relate to mortality.
We studied 107 patients (28 female, age 67+/-1 years, NYHA class 2.6+/-0.6 and LVEF 29+/-1%, mean+/-SEM) and 21 controls. Cardiac cachexia was present in 32 patients. Hsp70 was detectable in 41% of CHF patients and in only 10% of controls. Overall serum levels were significantly higher in CHF patients vs. controls (7.13+/-1.34 vs. 0.38+/-0.26 ng/ml, p=0.004). Hsp70 levels were also higher in patients with advanced CHF according to NYHA class or the presence of cachexia (all p<0.05). There was no relation between Hsp70 and left ventricular ejection fraction, maximal oxygen consumption and several inflammatory cytokines (all p>0.05). During a median follow-up of 208 days (range 4-2745 days) 38 patients died. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that increased Hsp70 did not predict survival (p=0.17).
Hsp70 levels are elevated in CHF patients, particularly in those with cardiac cachexia and Hsp70 relates to disease severity but not to survival. The significance of the relationship of Hsp70 expression and morbidity in CHF needs further evaluation."

TIRC7 deficiency causes in vitro and in vivo augmentation of T and B cell activation and cytokine response.	The membrane protein T cell immune response cDNA 7 (TIRC7) was recently identified and was shown to play an important role in T cell activation. To characterize the function of TIRC7 in more detail, we generated TIRC7-deficient mice by gene targeting. We observed disturbed T and B cell function both in vitro and in vivo in TIRC7(-/-) mice. Histologically, primary and secondary lymphoid organs showed a mixture of hypo-, hyper-, and dysplastic changes of multiple lymphohemopoietic compartments. T cells from TIRC7(-/-) mice exhibited significantly increased proliferation and expression of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and IL-4 in response to different stimuli. Resting T cells from TIRC7(-/-) mice exhibited decreased CD62L, but increased CD11a and CD44 expression, suggesting an in vivo expansion of memory/effector T cells. Remarkably, activated T cells from TIRC7(-/-) mice expressed lower levels of CTLA-4 in comparison with wild-type cells. B cells from TIRC7-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher in vitro proliferation following stimulation with anti-CD40 Ab or LPS plus IL-4. B cell hyperreactivity was reflected in vivo by elevated serum levels of various Ig classes and higher CD86 expression on B cells. Furthermore, TIRC7 deficiency resulted in an augmented delayed-type hypersensitivity response that was also reflected in increased mononuclear infiltration in the skin obtained from TIRC7-deficient mice food pads. In summary, the data strongly support an important role for TIRC7 in regulating both T and B cell responses.

Treatment of cytomegalovirus disease with valganciclovir in renal transplant recipients: a single center experience.	Recent data suggest valganciclovir (VGC) to be as effective as ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of oral valganciclovir in renal transplant patients with symptomatic CMV infection. Twenty-one patients with symptomatic CMV infection received VGC in doses adjusted to renal function until resolution of CMV antigenemia. The patients were followed for a mean of 5.5 months. During therapy, CMV antigenemia dropped in all patients from pretreatment positive levels of 5.2 +/- 3.7 to negative values of 0.25 +/- 0.2 positive cells/10,000 PBMC (P<0.001). After cessation of therapy, none of patients developed relapse of CMV antigenemia/symptoms within the follow-up. VGC therapy was well tolerated in all patients and no major adverse effects occurred. This pilot trial showed VGC to be safe and highly effective in antiviral therapy after renal transplantation. However, subsequent multicenter clinical trials for treatment of CMV disease are necessary.

Enhanced granulysin mRNA expression in urinary sediment in early and delayed acute renal allograft rejection.	"Acute rejection (aRx) has a major impact on the long-term outcome of renal allografts, and its diagnosis is contingent on the invasive procedure of allograft biopsy. New immunosuppressive protocols have reduced the incidence but have not abolished this problem. Moreover, aRx is now more frequently seen several weeks after transplantation in outpatients. A noninvasive diagnostic test for predicting aRx could improve the management and outcome. The recently described measurement of urinary mRNA expression offers a new noninvasive approach.
In this study, the authors monitored the urinary mRNA expression (221 specimens from 26 patients) of various immune molecules by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for up to 3 months after kidney transplantation. Most of the patients received anti-interleukin (IL)-2 receptor monoclonal antibody induction and tacrolimus-based maintenance immunosuppression, which resulted in a low incidence of aRx. To verify the ""rejection"" markers, an additional nine samples of patients with aRx were analyzed.
Granulysin mRNA increase (vs. 95% confidence interval of 159 urine samples from nonrejecting patients) was detected during 11 of 14 aRx episodes, and follow-up studies showed its predictive value for delayed aRx episodes, even weeks before enhanced serum creatinine was observed. Granulysin induction was associated with enhanced regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA expression in 8 of 11 samples. Other cytotoxic effector molecules (granzyme B, perforin, FasL), cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, RANTES, IL-2, IL-10, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor-beta), CD3, and CCR1 showed less specificity and sensitivity.
The authors' data illustrate that the noninvasive kinetic mRNA expression measurement of defined markers in urinary cells of renal allograft recipients allows the early noninvasive detection of ongoing aRx."

RDP58, a novel immunomodulatory peptide, ameliorates clinical signs of disease in the Lewis rat model of acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	The therapeutic value of a novel immunomodulatory peptide, RDP58, was investigated in the acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). RDP58 is a 10-amino acid peptide with two major activities: (i) inhibition of inflammatory TH1 cytokines such as TNFalpha, IFNgamma, and IL12 and (ii) up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Experiments in which EAE-induced Lewis rats exhibit an acute monophasic episode of disease demonstrated that a single intracerebroventricular injection of RDP58 is effective in preventing clinical signs of disease. The therapeutic effect on disease activity was observed at all pre-onset administration times and at all doses tested. Consistent with disease activity in vivo, RDP58-treated animals had reduced cellular infiltration within the spinal cord along with decreased TNFalpha expression levels. The data in this proof of concept study support the premise that RDP58, as a platform molecule, may be a promising new therapeutic intervention in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Confirmation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by flow cytometry after ex vivo incubation of peripheral blood T cells with an ESAT-6-derived peptide pool.	"The presence of a T-cell response to the early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6) indicates previous infection with or exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Measuring this response is useful for identifying individuals infected with M. tuberculosis. It was also reported that the frequencies of ESAT-6-specific T cells correlate with disease state. Established procedures measure secreted T-cell cytokines following whole blood stimulation with recombinant ESAT-6 protein or use Elispot as a read-out.
A single ESAT-6- spanning pool of overlapping peptides (15 amino acids length with 11 overlaps) was used for overnight stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 15 patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 11 healthy controls. T-cell responses were rated positive if interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells were identified above background level, using 4-color cytokine flow cytometry.
Thirteen of 15 (87%) patients, but none of the healthy controls, had a positive CD4 T-cell response to the ESAT-6 spanning peptide pool. The frequencies of IFN-gamma-producing cells varied between 1 and 167 per 10,000 CD4 T cells. The test performed as well as the tests described in the literature.
Cytokine flow cytometry following PBMC stimulation with an ESAT-6 spanning peptide pool is a useful laboratory test for ESAT-6-specific T cells combining precise counting and multi-parameter phenotyping."

Cloning of murine IL-22 receptor alpha 2 and comparison with its human counterpart.	We have identified the mouse and rat homologs of human interleukin-22 receptor alpha 2 (IL-22R alpha 2) and compared the localization, structure, and expression of the encoding murine and human genes. The mouse IL-22R alpha 2-encoding gene is located on chromosome 10A3 between, like in human, the genes for interferon-gamma R1 and IL-20R1. It spans a region of approximately 10 kb therefore being three times shorter than the human gene. Although the overall gene structure in both species is similar, the mouse gene lacks a counterpart to the third coding exon of the human gene known to be alternatively spliced. Like in human, mouse and rat IL-22R alpha 2 exist only as soluble receptors as deduced from the lack of transmembrane and intracellular domains encoding sequences. Quantitative expression analyses showed, analogically to the human system, a limited tissue distribution of mouse IL-22R alpha 2 mRNA. Differential modulation of IL-22R alpha 2 mRNA expression was observed upon systemic inflammation in mice in spleen, thymus, and lymph node.

Nonimmunologic complications and gene polymorphisms of immunoregulatory cytokines in long-term renal transplants.	"While the influence of cytokine gene polymorphisms on immunologic complications after organ transplantation is widely evaluated, little is known about predictive value of cytokine genotype for the development of nonimmunologic post-transplant complications: hypertension, dyslipoproteinemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia.
The -1082IL-10, -308TNF-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) (codon 10, 25), -174IL-6, +874IFN-gamma gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were studied in 278 long-term renal transplants by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) with respect to nonimmunologic post-transplant complications.
Significant association of the TGF-beta (codon 25) GG genotype with hyperuricemia (P= 0.0013) and dyslipoproteinemia (P= 0.0171) was found. The TGF-beta1 (codon 25) CG genotype was detected more frequently in patients with normal uric acid levels. The +874IFN-gamma AA genotype was associated with type 2/steroid-induced diabetes (P= 0.0127). Frequency of the -1082IL-10 AG genotype was significantly higher in hyperuricemic patients versus controls (P= 0.0022). No associations of polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-beta codon 10 genes with hyperuricemia, dyslipoproteinemia, or diabetes were detected. We failed to observe significant differences in cytokine genotype distribution between hypertensive and normotensive patients.
We established an association of particular cytokine genotypes with nonimmunologic post-transplant complications. This supports an idea that assessment of cytokine SNPs may allow more accurate prediction of nonimmunologic complications and appropriate adjustment of pre-emptive treatments in long-term transplant patients."

Intratumoral infusion of interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma induces tumor invasion with macrophages and lymphocytes in a rat glioma model.	Malignant gliomas are hard to treat successfully. Like other treatments immune therapy fails presumably due to low concentration of immune modifiers within the tumor. However, convection-enhanced delivery (CED) may overcome this problem. So, we analyzed the effect of intratumoral delivery of interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma by CED on tumor immune cell invasion in a rat glioma model. Tumors were implanted into the left caudate nucleus and tumor growth was demonstrated by MRI. Afterwards intratumoral infusion of IL-1beta or IFN-gamma was started for 48 h. Then animals were sacrificed and the number of tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes as well as macrophages was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that intratumoral cytokine infusion using CED leads to a strong tumor invasion with macrophages and lymphocytes suggesting a tumor specific immune response.

Interleukin-10: an important immunoregulatory cytokine with major impact on psoriasis.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is a pluripotent cytokine with effects on numerous cell populations, in particular circulating and resident immune cells as well as epithelial cells. With its potent immunoregulatory capacities its main biological function seems to be the limitation and termination of inflammatory responses. Thus its low level expression found in psoriasis may have pathophysiological relevance for this immune disease. Remarkably, induction of IL-10 expression was found by conventional antipsoriatic therapies, supporting the hypothesis that IL-10 may be a key cytokine in psoriasis and that application of this cytokine itself may have therapeutic effects. In first clinical trials in patients with established psoriasis IL-10 showed moderate antipsoriatic effects and was well tolerated. Moreover, long term application in psoriatic patients remission showed that IL-10 therapy decreases the incidence of relapse and prolongs the disease free interval. The immunological effects observed during these clinical studies together with in vitro observations suggests that IL-10 exerts its antipsoriatic activity by effects on different cell populations including antigen presenting cells and T-cells (lasting type 1/ type 2 cytokine balance shift), but not through direct effects on keratinocytes. In conclusion IL-10 seems to have major importance in psoriasis. Further investigations, in particular multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind trials are required to fully determine whether IL-10 application will become a successful antipsoriatic therapy.

Analysis of antigen-specific T-cell responses with synthetic peptides--what kind of peptide for which purpose?	The analysis of T-cell responses to peptides has recently become a busy area of immunologic research. Peptides may be used as single stimulants, pools or libraries, or as part of peptide/major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) for direct T-cell receptor staining. For stimulating T cells, peptides must be bound to MHC molecules. In this study we have used 9- or 10-amino acid peptides, 15-amino acid peptides containing stimulating shorter sequences, and peptides with modified C-terminal function. On average 67% of the T cells from healthy cytomegalovirus-positive donors that bound a frequently used cytomegalovirus pp65/HLA-A*0201 tetramer were able to produce interferon-gamma on stimulation with the respective 9-amino acid peptide. Peptides of 15 amino acids length used at the same concentration (in microg/ml) stimulated CD8 T cells somewhat less efficiently (on average 77% of the frequencies induced with the respective shorter peptides). Modifications of 9-amino acid peptides such as addition of amino acids or functional groups often resulted in a decreased ability to stimulate. However, based on our own results, published data, and theoretic considerations, we conclude that sets of peptides of 15 amino acids length with 11 amino acids overlap represent a good compromise for stimulating both CD8 and CD4 T cells in a number of applications. These parameters may be modified subject to the purpose of a study.

Decline of surface MHC I by adenoviral gene transfer of anti-MHC I intrabodies in human endothelial cells-new perspectives for the generation of universal donor cells for tissue transplantation.	"The seeding of small-calibre vascular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts with endothelial cells provides an increase in biocompatibility of the graft surface. The harvest and ex vivo culture of autologous endothelial cells is highly delicate. Allogeneic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) could be a potential cell source-however, rejection might occur due to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I mismatches. Lowering cell surface MHC I expression on endothelial cells by gene transfer of an anti-MHC I intrabody might reduce graft failure. The intrabody consists of a single-chain variable fragment (sFv) of an anti-MHC I antibody, carrying a terminal KDEL sequence to retain the molecule together with the MHC I inside the endoplasmic reticulum.
Adenoviral gene transfer was used to express the intrabody in HUVEC. The MHC I surface expression was measured 48 h after transduction by flow cytometry. Functional effects of the intrabody expression were analyzed in a calcein release cytotoxicity assay.
A transduction efficiency of more than 95% with EGFP-adenovirus indicates a sufficient gene transfer into HUVEC. Intrabody-adenovirus-transduced HUVEC show a massive reduction in MHC I surface expression creating almost a complete 'knockout' phenotype. Stimulation with inflammatory cytokines could not overcome this effect. The cell lysis of anti-MHC I intrabody-expressing HUVEC in a cytotoxicity assay is reduced when compared with the level of the MHC mismatched control.
Our data indicate that HUVEC with reduced levels of MHC I might be used as universal donor cells for the seeding of vascular grafts."

Random screening of proteins for HLA-A*0201-binding nine-amino acid peptides is not sufficient for identifying CD8 T cell epitopes recognized in the context of HLA-A*0201.	HLA-A2 is the most frequent HLA molecule in Caucasians with HLA-A*0201 representing the most frequent allele; it was also the first human HLA allele for which peptide binding prediction was developed. The Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section of the National Institutes of Health (BIMAS) and the University of Tübingen (Syfpeithi) provide the most popular prediction algorithms of peptide/MHC interaction on the World Wide Web. To test these predictions, HLA-A*0201-binding nine-amino acid peptides were searched by both algorithms in 19 structural CMV proteins. According to Syfpeithi, the top 2% of predicted peptides should contain the naturally presented epitopes in 80% of predictions (www.syfpeithi.de). Because of the high number of predicted peptides, the analysis was limited to 10 randomly chosen proteins. The top 2% of peptides predicted by both algorithms were synthesized corresponding to 261 peptides in total. PBMC from 10 HLA-A*0201-positive and CMV-seropositive healthy blood donors were tested by ex vivo stimulation with all 261 peptides using crossover peptide pools. IFN-gamma production in T cells measured by CFC was used as readout. However, only one peptide was found to be stimulating in one single donor. As a result of this work, we report a potential new T cell target protein, one previously unknown CD8-T cell-stimulating peptide, and an extensive list of CMV-derived potentially strong HLA-A*0201-binding peptides that are not recognized by T cells of HLA-A*0201-positive CMV-seropositive donors. We conclude that MHC/peptide binding predictions are helpful for locating epitopes in known target proteins but not necessarily for screening epitopes in proteins not known to be T cell targets.

FTY720 prevents anti-CD4 mAb-induced tolerance but cannot reverse established tolerance in a rat kidney transplantation model.	FTY720 is highly effective in various models of transplantation and autoimmunity. In order to find drugs that act synergistically with a tolerance-inducing nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb we studied this combination in a strong DA to LEW kidney transplantation model. Rats were treated with 0.3 mg/kg of FTY720 for 14 days and anti-CD4 mAb RIB5/2, alone or in combination. After kidney transplantation serum creatinine and blood lymphocyte counts were monitored. Immunohistology, ELISPOT and TaqMan trade mark -PCR analysis of biopsies were performed. Short-term application of RIB5/2 but not FTY720 induced long-term survival of kidney transplants. Moreover, the combination of FTY720 + RIB5/2 prevented tolerance induction. In the combination group serum creatinine levels increased 1 week after cessation of therapy and all rats died from uremia within 72 days. Intragraft immunohistology, ELISPOT and real-time RT-PCR analysis at day 21 demonstrated an enhanced T-cell infiltration and activation but a diminished up-regulation of protective genes in the grafts from recipients receiving the combination therapy. In contrast, delayed application of FTY720 to RIB5/2-treated rats did not interact with RIB5/2-induced tolerance. In summary, FTY720 is powerful in preventing intragraft infiltration by naive T cells but this might also affect the early development of graft-protecting regulatory T cells and tolerance induction.

A protocol for combining proliferation, tetramer staining and intracellular cytokine detection for the flow-cytometric analysis of antigen specific T-cells.	Flow-cytometry can be used in different ways in order to analyze or enumerate antigen specific T-cells. The three basic principles are direct staining of the T-cell receptor using so called tetramer reagents, staining intracellular cytokines following antigen-specific ex vivo T-cell activation or staining with dyes that are incorporated (increase in staining) or distributed between daughter cells (decrease in staining) upon proliferation in response to a specific antigen challenge. Each system has its advantages and disadvantages. Here we demonstrate that tetramer staining, cytokine flow cytometry and staining with CFDA-SE can be combined permitting the analysis of proliferation and cytokine production with a subset of T-cells specific for a single peptide antigen.

Monoclonal antibody specific for TIRC7 induces donor-specific anergy and prevents rejection of cardiac allografts in mice.	T cell immune response c-DNA (TIRC7) is up-regulated during the early stages of T-cell activation in response to alloantigens. In this study, we analyzed the effects of newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against TIRC7 in acute cardiac allograft rejection. Fully vascularized heterotopic allogeneic heart transplantation was performed in mice across a full-mismatch barrier (C57Bl/10 into CBA). Recipients received seven injections (day 0-7) of a novel anti-TIRC7 mAb or remained untreated. Graft survival, histology and ex vivo lymphocyte functions were tested. Targeting of TIRC7 with an anti-TIRC7 mAb diminishes lymphocyte infiltration into grafts resulting in delay of morphological graft damage and prolongation of allograft survival. The lymphocytes from anti-TIRC7 mAb-treated animals exhibit hypo-responsiveness without evidence of lymphocyte depletion against the donor allo-antigens. Proliferation and expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were down-regulated while interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 expression were spared. Moreover, anti-TIRC7 mAb enhanced up-regulation of CTLA-4 expression but suppressed up-regulation of CD25 on stimulated lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Ligation of TIRC7 has important effects on the regulation of co-stimulatory signaling pathways associated with suppressing of T-cell activation. Targeting of TIRC7 may therefore provide a novel therapeutic approach for modulating T cell immune responses during organ transplantation.

IFN-gamma regulation in anti-CD4 antibody-induced T cell unresponsiveness.	The anti-rat CD4 mAb RIB5/2 is very potent in inducing allospecific tolerance in vivo. It is interesting that the unresponsiveness is breakable by exogenous IL-2 applied during the induction phase of tolerance. The molecular mechanisms underlying anti-CD4 antibody-mediated inhibition of allospecific T cell activation and how this is antagonized by exogenous IL-2 were investigated. Anti-CD4 treatment, in vivo and in vitro, completely abrogated IL-2 production by alloreactive T cells. In contrast, anti-CD4-treated alloactivated T cells showed similar IFN-gamma mRNA expression as untreated alloactivated T cells but did not secrete any protein. Thus, the anti-CD4 antibody cannot prevent IFN-gamma mRNA expression but is interfering with posttranscriptional mechanisms that control IFN-gamma production during alloactivation of T cells. Addition of IL-2 but not IL-15 to anti-CD4-treated alloactivated T cells restored IFN-gamma protein production without leading to enhanced IFN-gamma mRNA expression. Further investigations revealed a diminished activation of translation initiation factor eIF2alpha in anti-CD4-treated T cells, which was restored by exogenous IL-2. As activated eIF2alpha is essential for the translation of IFN-gamma mRNA, the results may explain the reversibility of anti-CD4-induced unresponsiveness by exogenous IL-2. Furthermore, these results not only shed further light onto the molecular mechanisms of tolerance induction but also reveal the possible weaknesses of anti-CD4 antibody-induced unresponsiveness.

Expression profiling of IL-10-regulated genes in human monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from psoriatic patients during IL-10 therapy.	Interleukin-10 (IL-10), originally identified as an inhibitor of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, exerts multiple immunomodulatory functions. Its ability to inhibit a Th1 response has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of IL-10 functions. We aimed at identifying possible mediators of in vitro IL-10 treatment in monocytes by gene chip technology using Hu95a Affymetrix mRNA arrays with 12,000 genes. To prove relevance of the identified genes for the clinical situation we compared these in vitro results with genes being regulated by IL-10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from psoriatic patients undergoing IL-10 therapy. A high proportion of the 1,600 genes up-regulated and 1,300 genes down-regulated in vitro was found to be similarly regulated in vivo. Some genes, which were previously unknown to be regulated by IL-10, can be assigned to known IL-10 functions like e.g. the increase of pathogen clearance. Other new potentially immunomodulating genes have been identified to be regulated by IL-10, but their impact needs to be experimentally evaluated. We could confirm a recently reported up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). However, we demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-10 remain functional even when HO-1 is irreversibly inhibited.

Proteasome inhibitors: a novel tool to suppress human cytomegalovirus replication and virus-induced immune modulation.	Recently, we like others, demonstrated that systemic inflammation is the most important mechanism involved in (re)activation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in both immunocompetent patients. By in vitro studies the eukaryotic transcription factor NF-kappaB could be identified as the key mediator of TNF-alpha- and IE1-dependent stimulation of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity, which is crucial for initiation of viral gene expression during reactivation from latency as well as productive infection. The enzymatic proteasome complex plays a central role in regulating intracellular processes, including the activation of NF-kappaB. As present antiviral strategies target mainly late events in HCMV replication (DNA replication, virus assembly) that do not completely prevent virus mediated immunopathogenesis, we wondered whether proteasome inhibitors might be a novel tool for targeting the interaction between inflammation and HCMV (re)activation. Here, proteasome inhibitors like MG132, PSI, II and III (MG262) have been shown to block both TNF-alpha-associated up-regulation of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter in monocytic cells in an in vitro transient transfection system and HCMV replication in permissive embryonal fibroblasts. Importantly, ganciclovir-resistant HCMV strains are sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on HCMV replication was found to be specific as replication of other herpes viruses, like HSV-1 and HSV-2, under identical experimental conditions was not influenced. Inhibition of HCMV replication correlated with a delayed and significantly reduced expression of IE proteins, particularly of the IE2 protein, suggesting that MG132 blocks HCMV replication at an immediate early stage of infection. Early and late protein synthesis as shown exemplary for the pp52 (DNA-binding protein) and p68 (structural protein) protein production and viral DNA synthesis were also inhibited. Suppression of HCMV replication could be correlated with an increased cytosolic accumulation of IkappaB as well as a reduced NF-kappaB binding activity in nuclear extracts of MG132-treated cells, which mainly regards NF-kappaB p50. MG132 also reduced the immune modulatory activity of the virus by abrogating virus-induced up-regulation of cellular ICAM-1. These data suggest that short-term therapy with proteasome inhibitors might be an alternative strategy to prevent (re)activation, replication and immune modulatory activity of HCMV in patients with systemic inflammation.

Preassociation of nonactivated STAT3 molecules demonstrated in living cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer: a new model of STAT activation?	"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are crucial molecules in cytokine signaling. In the conventional model of STAT activation, STAT molecules are recruited from a latent pool of cytoplasmic monomers to the activated cytokine receptor. After binding to the receptor, they get tyrosine-phosphorylated, dissociate from the receptor, and translocate to the nucleus as activation-induced dimers. Recently, several publications questioned this model of STAT activation and showed the existence of preassociated STAT molecules before activation. We were able to demonstrate the existence of these preassociated STAT3 molecules in living mammalian cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Our results support the new hypothesis that STAT molecules exist in the cytoplasm as dimers or multimers and point to an activation-induced change in STAT3 conformation. Therefore, we propose a new model of STAT activation and discuss a hypothetical structure of ""cytoplasmic"" STAT dimers as opposed to the known ""activation-induced"" dimer."

The activation status of neuroantigen-specific T cells in the target organ determines the clinical outcome of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.	The clinical picture of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is critically dependent on the nature of the target autoantigen and the genetic background of the experimental animals. Potentially lethal EAE is mediated by myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells in Lewis rats, whereas transfer of S100beta- or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific T cells causes intense inflammatory response in the central nervous system (CNS) with minimal disease. However, in Dark Agouti rats, the pathogenicity of MOG-specific T cells resembles the one of MBP-specific T cells in the Lewis rat. Using retrovirally transduced green fluorescent T cells, we now report that differential disease activity reflects different levels of autoreactive effector T cell activation in their target tissue. Irrespective of their pathogenicity, the migratory activity, gene expression patterns, and immigration of green fluorescent protein(+) T cells into the CNS were similar. However, exclusively highly pathogenic T cells were significantly reactivated within the CNS. Without local effector T cell activation, production of monocyte chemoattractants was insufficient to initiate and propagate a full inflammatory response. Low-level reactivation of weakly pathogenic T cells was not due to anergy because these cells could be activated by specific antigen in situ as well as after isolation ex vivo.

Donor hypertension increases graft immunogenicity and intensifies chronic changes in long-surviving renal allografts.	"Marginal donor organs are used increasingly for transplantation. To define the influences of donor hypertension, we compared the behavior of kidney allografts from hypertensive and normotensive donors in an established rat model of chronic rejection.
Donor hypertension was induced by partial occlusion of the right renal artery with a silver clip. After 10 weeks, the left kidney was removed and transplanted. Normotensive animals served as controls. All recipients were treated with a low dose of cyclosporine for 10 days (1.5 mg/kg). Blood pressure and proteinuria were determined weekly four times after transplantation. To examine the effects of donor hypertension on late events, grafts (n=6/time point) were examined morphologically and by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis at serial intervals.
Recipients of kidneys from hypertensive donors developed systemic hypertension in contrast with normotensive controls (P<0.05). Allografts from hypertensive animals showed accelerated deterioration in structure and function after transplantation. Proteinuria became significantly elevated as early as 6 weeks (P<0.05) compared with controls and increased progressively thereafter (P<0.005). Grafts from hypertensive donors, histologically normal at the time of engraftment, developed significant morphologic deterioration after 12 weeks (P<0.01). Changes in allografts from normotensive donors remained minor. mRNA of proinflammatory mediators in hypertensive donor grafts (P<0.01) was up-regulated before transplantation and increased progressively over time (P<0.01).
Donor hypertension intensifies the chronic injury associated with allogeneic kidney transplantation in the rat model used. This condition also leads to induction of recipient hypertension and may be a more important risk factor for chronic graft dysfunction than previously appreciated."

Alterations of the immune response with increasing recipient age are associated with reduced long-term organ graft function of rat kidney allografts.	"Clinically, an increasing number of older recipients are listed for transplantation. We examined recipient age-associated alterations of the immune response and their effects on graft function.
Three- and 18-month-old Lewis (LEW) rats received kidneys from 3- and 18-month-old Fischer 344 (F344) rats (1.5 mg/kg/d cyclosporine A for 10 days; n=6/group) and were observed for 180 days. In additional groups, double kidney transplantations were performed to determine the impact of nephron mass and recipient age on graft outcome.

Increasing recipient age resulted in a significant decrease in renal allograft function (P<0.001), more advanced morphologic evidence of chronic allograft damage (P<0.001), and greater cellular infiltration (P<0.05) and major histocompatibility complex expression (P<0.01) within grafts. Additional in vitro studies examined age-related changes in the cellular immune response by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and alloreactive enzyme-linked immunospot: splenocytes from old LEW rats produced significantly more interleukin (IL)-2 (P<0.0001), IL-4 (P<0.05), interferon (IFN)-gamma (P<0.0001), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P<0.05). IFN-gamma-producing memory-type T cells were significantly elevated in older rats (P<0.0001). Moreover, they revealed significantly more alloreactive T cells directed against F344 (146 +/- 64.2 and 512 +/- 277/10(6) T cells; P<0.05). Double renal allografts from young donors into old recipients confirmed an independent effect of recipient age on the acceleration of chronic graft deterioration.
The enhanced cellular immune responsiveness in elderly recipients was associated with advanced chronic graft injury. Clinically, older recipients may need a modified immunosuppression."

Preventive antibacterial treatment improves the general medical and neurological outcome in a mouse model of stroke.	"Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a high incidence of infections after severe stroke and their prominent role in morbidity and mortality in stroke patients. In a mouse model, it has been shown recently that stroke is coupled with severe and long-lasting immunosuppression, which is responsible for the development of spontaneous systemic infections. Here, we investigated in the same model the effects of preventive antibiotic treatment on survival and functional outcome of experimental stroke.
Mice were subjected to experimental stroke by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 60 minutes. A group of mice received moxifloxacin (6x100 mg/kg body weight every 2 hours over 12 hours) either immediately or 12 hours after MCAO. Control animals received the vector only. Behavior, neurological deficit, fever, survival, and body weight were monitored over 14 days. In a subgroup, infarct volume was measured 4 days after MCAO. Microbiological assessment was based on cultures of lung tissue, blood, and feces of animals 3 days after stroke. For a dose-response study, moxifloxacin was given immediately after MCAO in different doses and at different time points.
Microbiological analyses of blood and lung tissue demonstrated high bacterial burden, mainly Escherichia coli, 3 days after stroke. Accordingly, we observed clinical and histological signs of septicemia and pneumonia. Moxifloxacin prevented the development of infections and fever, significantly reduced mortality, and improved neurological outcome.
Preventive antibiotic treatment may be an important new therapeutical approach to improve outcome in patients with severe stroke."

Detection of antigen-specific T cells by cytokine flow cytometry: the use of whole blood may underestimate frequencies.	Antigen-specific T cells may be detected and enumerated by short-term ex vivo antigen-specific stimulation followed by cytokine flow cytometry. Most frequently, intracellular IFN-gamma is used to identify T cells specific for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus or HIV. Some researchers use whole blood, others peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in this assay; however, the performance of the two systems has never been directly compared. Blood was drawn from previously characterized healthy CMV-positive donors, and CMV-derived peptides or CMV lysate were used as stimulants. In an initial series of experiments, lithium-heparin was identified as the best coagulant to be used. Dose-response curves were established using concentrations between 0.1 and 40 microg/ml of peptides and between 0.1 and 20 microg/ml of virus lysate, respectively. IFN-gamma-positive T cells were expressed as percent of the reference population, and frequencies measured in whole blood and PBMC were compared. Maximum responses were consistently higher in PBMC than in whole blood and were reached at lower concentrations of stimulant. In several instances, responses identified with PBMC were not at all detected with whole blood. In summary, studies using whole blood in this type of assay are likely to underestimate the frequencies of antigen-specific T cells.

Stress induced IL-10 does not seem to be essential for early monocyte deactivation following cardiac surgery.	An increase in circulating levels of IL-10 is believed to contribute to immunosuppression caused by major surgery. Cortisol and catecholamines have been shown to be important costimulatory factors for IL-10 secretion in humans. As thoracic epidural block (TEB) should blunt the perioperative increases in cortisol and catecholamines we investigated whether IL-10 secretion is influenced by TEB. Twenty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive either general anesthesia (GA) or GA plus TEB. Sensory and pain levels were measured to demonstrate clinical effectiveness. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, IL-6 and IL-10 as well as monocyte surface expression of HLA-DR and their ex vivo capacity to release TNF-alpha after LPS stimulation were measured perioperatively. TEB was clinically effective and patients receiving TEB showed decreased circulating levels of IL-10. However, this decrease was independent of decreased levels of cortisol or epinephrine. No influence of TEB on IL-6 levels, monocyte capacity to ex vivo release TNF-alpha upon LPS stimulation or their expression of HLA-DR was found. In conclusion, high TEB reduces antiinflammatory immune suppressing mediators including IL-10 and stress mediators. At least in cardiac surgery patients the monocyte functional depression is not related to systemic release of IL-10 and the influence of cortisol or epinephrine is less important for early monocyte deactivation than what in vitro and animal models have suggested.

Characterization of the cytokine immune response in children who have experienced an episode of typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome.	The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Shiga toxin together substantially contribute to the pathophysiology of typical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Both factors have been shown to be immune stimulators and could play a key role in the individual innate immune response, characterized by proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. By use of a whole blood stimulation model, we therefore compared the LPS- and superantigen-induced cytokine responses in children who had been having recovering from an acute episode of typical HUS for at least 6 months (group 1) with those in controls, who consisted of patients seen in the pediatric neurology outpatient department for routine examination (group 2). Samples were analyzed for cytokine protein levels and the levels of mRNA production. LPS stimulation revealed lower levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10) (P < 0.05) and increased levels of gamma interferon (P < 0.05) and increased ratios of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.05 for the IL-1beta/IL-10 ratio; P < 0.05 for the tumor necrosis factor alpha/IL-10 ratio) in group 1. In addition superantigen stimulation showed decreased IL-2 levels in group 1 (P < 0.01). Our results suggest an alteration of the cytokine response characterized by high proinflammatory cytokine levels and low anti-inflammatory cytokine levels as well as low levels of IL-2 production in children who have experienced an episode of typical HUS. We hypothesize that this altered immune response is not a residual effect of the infection but a preexisting characteristic of the patient. This could be one reason why individuals infected with EHEC are potentially predisposed to a systemic disease (HUS).

Elimination of protein kinase MK5/PRAK activity by targeted homologous recombination.	MK5 (mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]-activated protein kinase 5), also designated PRAK (p38-regulated and -activated kinase), was deleted from mice by homologous recombination. Although no MK5 full-length protein and kinase activity was detected in the MK5 knockout mice, the animals were viable and fertile and did not display abnormalities in tissue morphology or behavior. In addition, these mice did not show increased resistance to endotoxic shock or decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine production. Hence, MK5 deletion resulted in a phenotype very different from the complex inflammation-impaired phenotype of mice deficient in MK2, although MK2 and MK5 exhibit evolutional, structural, and apparent extensive functional similarities. To explain this discrepancy, we used wild-type cells and embryonic fibroblasts from both MK2 and MK5 knockout mice as controls to reexamine the mechanism of activation, the interaction with endogenous p38 MAPK, and the substrate specificity of both enzymes. In contrast to MK2, which shows interaction with and chaperoning properties for p38 MAPK and which is activated by extracellular stresses such as arsenite or sorbitol treatment, endogenous MK5 did not show these properties. Furthermore, endogenous MK5 is not able to phosphorylate Hsp27 in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that the differences between the phenotypes of MK5- and MK2-deficient mice result from clearly different functional properties of both enzymes.

Old-for-old kidney allocation allows successful expansion of the donor and recipient pool.	Allocation of kidneys from donors older than 64 years to recipients older than 64 years was started in 1999 to improve use of older donor kidneys. Kidneys are allocated locally without HLA-matching to keep cold ischemia short. We compared survival and rejection rates in elderly patients allocated in the old-for-old program (ESP) to patients aged 60 years and older based on HLA-matching, expected ischemia and waiting time (ETKAS). The 69 ESP patients were older (67.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 63.9 +/- 2.9 years), had older donors (71.2 +/- 3.9 vs. 44.6 +/- 14.5 years) and more HLA-mismatches (4.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 1.6 +/- 1.7) than the 71 ETKAS patients, while ischemia was shorter (7.8 +/- 3.4 vs. 14.2 +/- 5.5 h). ESP and ETKAS had similar graft (1-year: 83.6% vs. 86.9%) and patient survival (85.2% vs. 89.5%). With the introduction of ESP, use of older recipients and donors rose from less than 2% to 16% and 11%, respectively. Incidence of acute rejections was significantly higher in the ESP group (1 year: 43.2% vs. 27.4%) and significantly correlated with the degree of HLA-matching. Introduction of old-for-old allocation allows successful expansion of the donor and recipient pool without affecting patient and graft survival. HLA-matching should not be ignored, as the risk of acute rejection in elderly patients is substantial.

Heme oxygenase-1 and its reaction product, carbon monoxide, prevent inflammation-related apoptotic liver damage in mice.	Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a stress-responsive enzyme that catabolizes heme into carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and iron, has previously been shown to protect grafts from ischemia/reperfusion injury and rejection. Here we investigated the protective potential of HO-1 in 5 models of immune-mediated liver injury. We found that up-regulation of endogenous HO-1 by cobalt-protoporphyrin-IX (CoPP) protected mice from apoptotic liver damage induced by anti-CD95 antibody (Ab) or d-galactosamine in combination with either anti-CD3 Ab, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). HO-1 induction prevented apoptotic liver injury, measured by inhibition of caspase 3 activation, although it did not protect mice from caspase-3-independent necrotic liver damage caused by concanavalin A (Con A) administration. In addition, overexpression of HO-1 by adenoviral gene transfer resulted in protection from apoptotic liver injury, whereas inhibition of HO-1 enzymatic activity by tin-protoporphyrin-IX (SnPP) abrogated the protective effect. HO-1-mediated protection seems to target parenchymal liver cells directly because CoPP treatment protected isolated primary hepatocytes from anti-CD95-induced apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, depletion of Kupffer cells (KCs) did not interfere with the protective effect in vivo. Exogenous CO administration or treatment with the CO-releasing agent methylene chloride mimicked the protective effect of HO-1, whereas treatment with exogenous biliverdin or overexpression of ferritin by recombinant adenoviral gene transfer did not. In conclusion, HO-1 is a potent protective factor for cytokine- and CD95-mediated apoptotic liver damage. Induction of HO-1 might be of a therapeutic modality for inflammatory liver diseases.

The pathophysiological role of cytokines in psoriasis.	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disorder. Recent data indicate that T cells and cytokines are of major importance in the pathophysiology of this frequent immune disease. The cutaneous and systemic overexpression of several proinflammatory cytokines, particularly type-1 cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, has been demonstrated. The overexpression of these proinflammatory cytokines is considered to be responsible for initiation, maintenance and recurrence of skin lesions. The cellular composition of the inflammatory infiltrate within the plaques as well as the keratinocyte hyperproliferation appears to be directed by cytokines as well. Thus, the overexpression of the chemoattractant IL-8 contributes to the accumulation of granulocytes, a characteristic finding in psoriatic lesions. In contrast to the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, a relatively low level of expression of the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-1RA and IL-10 has been found, suggesting an insufficient counterregulatory capacity in psoriasis which might have a genetic background. The new pathophysiologic understanding of psoriasis offers the opportunity for well-targeted therapeutic interventions which should be more effective and better tolerated than the approaches used thus far. In fact, the cytokine imbalance represents an interesting target. This is supported by the therapeutic effects of IL-10, a type-2 cytokine with major influence on immunoregulation, since it inhibits type-1/proinflammatory cytokine formation.

Kidney transplantation at the Charité: long tradition, elderly patients and the duration of hospitalization.	Since the sixties kidneys have been transplanted successfully at the 2 predecessors of today's transplant center at the Charité. So far, 1,290 kidneys were transplanted resulting in 89.8% overall graft survival at one year and 78.6% at 5 years. Several factors were associated with these results. Ischemia times were very short (11.9 +/- 7.3 hours). Patients with diabetic nephropathy were rarely transplanted without combined pancreas transplantation. Combined with a pancreas transplantation, kidney grafts fared even better than those of non-diabetic patients. The share of living donation is still rising and is associated with a better outcome than cadaveric grafts. In contrast, the effect of HLA mismatches was not very pronounced. Zero- and one-mismatch transplantations had a clear benefit over those with 2-3 mismatches, but higher numbers of mismatches did not lead to worse results. To expand the donor pool with kidneys from old donors (> 64 years) we participate in the Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) where these kidneys are allocated locally to recipients aged 65 years and older without HLA matching. The ischemia times for ESP kidneys were shorter (7.3 +/- 3.0 hours) but transplants were less well matched (4.2 +/- 2.1 mismatches). Graft survival was not different from controls aged 60 years and older who received a kidney from a donor under age 65. The ESP patients do not require prolonged hospitalization for transplantation (30.6 +/- 14.6 days versus 35.3 +/- 26.0 days in patients below 60 years). With the introduction of the ESP the number of transplantations in recipients aged 60 years and above have risen considerably.

Naturally occurring anti-IFN-gamma autoantibody and severe infections with Mycobacterium cheloneae and Burkholderia cocovenenans.	Recently various genetic defects in immunity mediated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) have been described, including mutations in the IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) and receptor 2 (IFN-gammaR2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT 1), and interleukin 12 receptor beta 1 (IL-12Rbeta1), and IL-12 p40 genes. These mutations are associated with the occurrence of severe infections with intracellular pathogens especially nontuberculous mycobacteria and vaccine-associated bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Here we report data on a previously healthy adult patient primarily presenting with severe infections with Burkholderia cocovenenans and subsequently Mycobacterium cheloneae. We found a strong inhibitory anti-IFN-gamma activity in the patient's plasma and identified a high-affinity neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma autoantibody. Unfortunately, the patient died due to severe sepsis before we knew the nature of the inhibitory activity. The application of alternative therapeutic approaches such as intravenous immunoglobulin or immunoadsorption may have been beneficial in this case. Screening for neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma autoantibodies should supplement testing for IFN-gamma and IL-12 pathway defects in patients with recurrent infections with intracellular pathogens, especially with nontuberculous mycobacteria.

Stroke-induced immunodeficiency promotes spontaneous bacterial infections and is mediated by sympathetic activation reversal by poststroke T helper cell type 1-like immunostimulation.	Infections are a leading cause of death in stroke patients. In a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia, we tested the hypothesis that a stroke-induced immunodeficiency increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. 3 d after ischemia, all animals developed spontaneous septicemia and pneumonia. Stroke induced an extensive apoptotic loss of lymphocytes and a shift from T helper cell (Th)1 to Th2 cytokine production. Adoptive transfer of T and natural killer cells from wild-type mice, but not from interferon (IFN)-gamma-deficient mice, or administration of IFN-gamma at day 1 after stroke greatly decreased the bacterial burden. Importantly, the defective IFN-gamma response and the occurrence of bacterial infections were prevented by blocking the sympathetic nervous system but not the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol drastically reduced mortality after stroke. These data suggest that a catecholamine-mediated defect in early lymphocyte activation is the key factor in the impaired antibacterial immune response after stroke.

Successful infliximab treatment of steroid and OKT3 refractory acute cellular rejection in two patients after intestinal transplantation.	Acute rejection resistant to established immunosuppressive rescue protocols remains the most prominent risk factor after intestinal transplantation. In two patients presenting with steroid-resistant severe acute cellular rejection 9 months and 2 years after intestinal transplantation, complete resolution was not achieved despite 5 and 10 days of OKT3 treatment, respectively, and high-dose triple baseline immunosuppression with tacrolimus, rapamycin, and steroids. There was a dissociated course of rejection with persistent moderate to severe rejection in the terminal portion of the graft despite complete recovery from rejection in the proximal parts. Both patients were treated with four subsequent infusions of infliximab (3 mg/kg body weight), a chimeric anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody. There was an immediate response regarding macroscopic appearance, graft histology, and clinical symptoms. Both patients recovered. In conclusion, infliximab has proven to be an effective rescue therapy in a selected group of patients with steroid and OKT3 refractory severe acute rejection after intestinal transplantation.

The impact of immune-activating processes following transplantation on chronic allograft nephropathy.	"The long-term success of organ transplantation is influenced by numerous alloantigen-dependent and -independent risk factors. However, only very little information is presently available on the influence of systemic immune-activating processes following organ engraftment.
To simulate the clinical situation of sequential organ transplantation, rat renal allograft recipients received additional immune activating stimuli (secondary donor-specific and third-party skin grafts) after transplantation at serial time intervals (4 and 8 weeks). The overall observation period was 16 weeks.
All control animals survived the observation period. In contrast, recipients receiving additional third-party or donor-specific skin grafts were beginning to die 12 weeks after organ engraftment with only few animals surviving 16 weeks. Systemic immune activation by additional third-party and in particular by additional donor-specific skin grafts resulted in significant temporary and long-term functional deterioration. Morphologic changes progressed significantly, particularly after a secondary challenge with donor-specific skin grafts. ED1+ monocytes/macrophages, T-cell infiltrates, and intragraft mRNA expression for CD25 were significantly elevated by 16 weeks, following an additional immune challenge. Analysis of early intragraft events showed strong up-regulation of CD25 transcripts, suggesting fast stimulation of intragraft immune processes.
Both alloantigen-specific and -unspecific systemic immune activation processes, following experimental organ transplantation, contribute to chronic graft deterioration. Those results seem relevant for long-term immunosuppressive protocols and clinical situations of sequential organ transplantation."

Cyclic AMP increases endogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor formation in monocytes and THP-1 macrophages despite attenuated TNF-alpha formation.	The cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is in broad clinical use to treat neutropenia, and trials on its use in immunosuppressed conditions and infections are ongoing. To apply G-CSF effectively, it is crucial to understand the regulation and distribution of its endogenous formation. Since G-CSF release is mediated, at least in part, by TNF-alpha formation, we investigated whether drugs suppressing TNF-alpha also impair G-CSF production. Surprisingly, G-CSF formation was enhanced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated blood from a pentoxifylline-treated patient. In the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP, forskolin, tolafentrine or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, LPS-induced G-CSF formation was enhanced in THP-1 cells, primary monocytes and whole blood. Correspondingly,rp-8-bromo-cAMP suppressed LPS-induced G-CSF release. Addition of prostaglandin E(2) enhanced and indomethacin suppressed G-CSF formation. Reporter gene studies showed that dibutyryl-cAMP enhanced LPS-induced G-CSF promoter activity, indicating a transcriptional up-regulation. Furthermore, disruption of a newly identified putative cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the G-CSF promoter demonstrated the regulatory role for G-CSF gene transcription. In conclusion, endogenous G-CSF formation critically depends on both TNF-alpha and cyclooxygenase products, exerting effects via cAMP and the CRE in the G-CSF promoter. This might have bearing for drug side effects, putative G-CSF mimetics and our understanding of G-CSF immunobiology.

Different faces of the heme-heme oxygenase system in inflammation.	The heme-heme oxygenase system has recently been recognized to possess important regulatory properties. It is tightly involved in both physiological as well as pathophysiological processes, such as cytoprotection, apoptosis, and inflammation. Heme functions as a double-edged sword. In moderate quantities and bound to protein, it forms an essential element for various biological processes, but when unleashed in large amounts, it can become toxic by mediating oxidative stress and inflammation. The effect of this free heme on the vascular system is determined by extracellular factors, such as hemoglobin/heme-binding proteins, haptoglobin, albumin, and hemopexin, and intracellular factors, including heme oxygenases and ferritin. Heme oxygenase (HO) enzyme activity results in the degradation of heme and the production of iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin.

Elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines and bacterial endotoxin in adults with congenital heart disease.	"Chronic heart failure is a state of immune activation, and endotoxin is a potential trigger for cytokine production. Our aim was to study whether immune activation and endotoxemia occur in adults with congenital heart disease. We prospectively measured tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2), interleukin-6, interleukin-10, endotoxin, and soluble CD14 levels in 52 consecutive adults with congenital heart disease (age 34 +/- 2 years [mean +/- SEM]) and 18 healthy controls (age 31 +/- 1 years). A variety of congenital heart lesions were studied: single ventricle physiology (n = 15), systemic right ventricle (n = 7), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 20), and ""other"" congenital heart disease (n = 10). Patients were subgrouped into asymptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I, n = 11), mild (NYHA class II, n = 30), and moderate/severe (NYHA class III/IV, n = 11) categories. Patients had elevated TNF and interleukin-6 levels compared with controls (TNF 2.8 vs 2.1 pg/ml, p <0.05; interleukin-6 8.5 vs 5.7 pg/ml, p <0.001). TNF levels were higher in patients with moderate/severe symptoms compared with patients who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (p <0.05). Soluble TNFR-1 levels related directly to the degree of systemic ventricular impairment (p <0.05). There were no significant differences in sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2, interleukin-10, or sCD14 levels between patients and controls. Endotoxin levels were greater in patients with congenital heart disease versus controls (0.40 vs 0.26 endotoxin units/ml, p <0.0001). Thus, adults with congenital heart disease have elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and bacterial endotoxin, which relate to functional status. Congenital heart disease in adults may be amenable to novel anti-inflammatory therapies in selected patients."

IL-10 increases tissue injury after selective intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.	OBJECTIVE This study focused on the effect of immunoregulatory cytokines on tissue injury after intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR). Furthermore, the role of nitric oxide, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and the transcription factor NF-kappaB/Rel in the disease process was evaluated.SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Oxidative stress and inflammatory gene products contribute to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). However, expression of stress proteins such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) and HO-1 might also provide protection against IRI. METHODS IR was achieved in Lewis rats by selective clamping of the superior mesenteric artery. IL-2 or IL-10 was administered intravenously before reperfusion. Animals were killed 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours after reperfusion. Tissue destruction was assessed by hyaluronic acid (HA) and aminoaspartate-transaminase (AST) serum levels, whereas reduction of glutathione (GSH) tissue levels was used as a marker for oxidative stress. Furthermore, the activation of NF-kappaB/Rel and the expression of NOS-2 and HO-1 were analyzed.RESULTS IR resulted in tissue destruction and significantly reduced GSH tissue levels in the intestines and liver. In addition, NF-kappaB/Rel activation and increased NOS-2 and HO-1 mRNA expression were detected in both organs after IR. IL-2 administration resulted in clinical improvement of the animals and was associated with increased NF-kappaB/Rel activation and enhanced NOS-2 and HO-1 mRNA expression. In contrast, IL-10 resulted in increased tissue destruction in both organs and sustained reduction of GSH levels in the intestines. Furthermore, IL-10 administration failed to enhance NF-kappaB/Rel activity, NOS-2 mRNA, or HO-1 mRNA expression after IR. CONCLUSION IL-10 resulted in increased tissue damage after intestinal IR. This detrimental effect of IL-10 might have been the result of reduced NOS-2 and HO-1 mRNA expression. In contrast, the beneficial effect of IL-2 might have relied on increased HO-1 expression and NOS-2 activity. These controversial effects of IL-2 and IL-10 might have been mediated through transcriptional regulation of NOS-2 and HO-1 gene expression.

TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) as a potential response marker for interferon-beta treatment in multiple sclerosis.	"Many patients with multiple sclerosis do not respond to interferon beta, which is widely used as an immunomodulatory treatment in this disease. We aimed to assess the functional relevance of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is upregulated on incubation with interferon beta, for clinical treatment response.
We quantified gene expression longitudinally by realtime-PCR of the peripheral immune cells of 82 patients with multiple sclerosis. In a first cohort of 62 patients, 20 were classified as first-year responders since they did not have relapses during treatment with interferon beta 1a; 19 were classified as first-year non-responders; and 23 developed neutralising antibodies to interferon beta. A second cohort, also characterised by MRI, consisted of 11 patients on interferon beta 1a and nine patients who were not treated. Concentrations of soluble TRAIL were determined by ELISA in serum samples of nine non-treated patients, 49 patients before treatment (29 responders, 20 non-responders), as well as longitudinally in a subset of 23 patients.
In both patient cohorts, drug-responders could be distinguished from non-responders by early and sustained induction of TRAIL (p<0.0001, each). In the presence of neutralising antibodies, initial upregulation of TRAIL expression was subsequently abrogated. Raised concentrations of soluble TRAIL in patients' serum samples before the start of treatment allowed prediction of the treatment response in the first year (ROC analysis with area under the curve 0.879 [0.785-0.974]).
Our data suggest that TRAIL expression is a candidate for pretreatment assessment and might thus be used as a prognostic marker of treatment response to interferon beta in multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, our observations have implications for the development of future immunoregulatory strategies in multiple sclerosis therapy."

Short-term immunosuppressive treatment of the donor ameliorates consequences of ischemia/ reperfusion injury and long-term graft function in renal allografts from older donors.	"Grafts from so-called ""marginal donors"" are increasingly used for organ transplantation. The combination of reduced organ quality and additional inflammatory damages may be particularly detrimental in these grafts. In a previous study, we showed the beneficial effects on long-term graft outcome of ""suboptimal"" grafts by the induction of heme oxygenase-1. Here we tested the impact of short-term donor treatment with established immunosuppressants.
Twelve-month-old Fischer 344 donor rats either were treated with prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, RAD, or FK506 24 hr and 1 hr before organ harvesting or remained untreated. Renal allografts were perfused with University of Wisconsin solution and kept at 4 degrees C for an ischemic period of 2 hr. Morphologic, immunohistologic, and real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses for relevant markers were performed at serial intervals and at the end of the observation period (6 months).
All animals survived the observation period, although the ischemic time resulted in accelerated chronic graft dysfunction. Grafts from donors treated with prednisolone or FK506 demonstrated significantly improved graft function and structure by 6 months. Mononuclear infiltrates were significantly reduced by the end of the observation period, whereas intragraft mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 were significantly altered during the early period after transplantation. Minor improvements in graft function and histologic alterations of suboptimal grafts were observed after pretreatment with mycophenolate mofetil and RAD.
Donor treatment with approved immunosuppressants, in particular prednisolone or FK506, represents a novel therapeutic strategy of clinical relevance, most importantly when using grafts from marginal donors."

Inactivated parapoxvirus ovis (Orf virus) has antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus.	It is known that some viruses are able to induce vigorous immune reactions. This study shows that inactivated parapoxvirus ovis (Orf virus), strain D1701 (PPVO), induces an autoregulatory cytokine response that involves the upregulation of IL-12, IL-18, IFN-gamma and other T helper 1-type cytokines and their subsequent downregulation, which is accompanied by induction of IL-4. An increase in IL-10 expression was also found in the livers of PPVO-treated mice. PPVO protects mice from lethal herpes simplex virus type 1 infection and guinea pigs from recurrent genital herpes disease. With dosages as low as 500 000 virus particles, PPVO is more potent than the current standard 3TC therapy in hepatitis B virus transgenic mice. No signs of inflammation or any other side effects were observed. PPVO induces IL-12, TNF-alpha and, together with a suboptimal concentration of Concanavalin A, IFN-gamma in human peripheral blood leukocytes as well. The principle of an autoregulatory cytokine induction by an inactivated virus might have advantages over existing immune therapies and it is concluded that inactivated PPVO should be investigated further for its potential use in antiviral therapy.

Serine proteinase inhibitor-9, an endogenous blocker of granzyme B/perforin lytic pathway, is hyperexpressed during acute rejection of renal allografts.	"Serine proteinase inhibitor (PI)-9 with a reactive center P1 (Glu)-P1' is a natural antagonist of granzyme B and is expressed in high levels in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In view of the role of CTL in acute rejection, we explored the hypothesis that PI-9 would be hyperexpressed during acute rejection. Because PI-9 can protect CTL from its own fatal arsenal and potentially enhance the vitality of CTL, we examined whether PI-9 levels correlate with the severity of rejection as well as predict subsequent graft function.
We obtained 95 urine specimens from 87 renal allograft recipients. RNA was isolated from the urinary cells and mRNA encoding PI-9, granzyme B, or perforin and a constitutively expressed 18S rRNA was measured with the use of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, and the level of expression was correlated with allograft status.
The levels of PI-9 (P=0.001), granzyme B (P<0.0001), and perforin mRNAs (P<0.0001), but not the levels of 18S rRNA (P=0.54), were higher in the urinary cells from the 29 patients with a biopsy-confirmed acute rejection than in the 58 recipients without acute rejection. PI-9 levels were significantly higher in patients with type II or higher acute rejection changes compared with those with less than type II changes (P=0.01). Furthermore, PI-9 levels predicted subsequent graft function (r=0.43, P=0.01).
PI-9 mRNA levels in urinary cells are diagnostic of acute rejection, predict renal allograft histology grade, and predict functional outcome following an acute rejection episode."

Subclinical activation of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and anti-CMV immune response in patients with atopic dermatitis.	"Microbiological infections are considered to be of pathophysiological importance in atopic dermatitis (AD). As yet, no information is available regarding cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in this disease. This, however, is of interest because of the high prevalence of latent infections in the general population, the frequent reactivation in inflammatory diseases, and the immunomodulating capacity of CMV.
To investigate the prevalence of latent CMV infection, the frequency of active CMV infection, and the immune response to CMV in patients with moderate to severe AD. Methods To detect active infection we analysed CMV antigen expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 27 patients with moderate to severe AD in comparison with 53 healthy volunteers. We used three monoclonal antibodies recognizing different CMV-encoded antigens and immunocytological staining (alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase technique).
Patients with AD had a higher mean frequency of CMV-positive PBMC: 2.25 per 10 000 vs. 0.74 per 10 000 in controls (P = 0.001) as well as a higher incidence of CMV antigenaemia: 29.6% vs. 7.5% (P < 0.01). Seropositivity for anti-CMV IgG antibodies indicated subclinical activation of latent infection. Remarkably, a clearance of CMV antigenaemia was observed during anti-eczematous treatment. Significantly higher plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, which is involved in CMV reactivation, and interleukin-12, which is crucial for an antiviral cellular immune response, were observed in AD patients in comparison with healthy volunteers. Furthermore, a significantly enhanced frequency of circulating activated HLA-DR+ T cells especially in CMV-seropositive AD patients (19.3% vs. 13.5% in seronegative AD patients vs. 10.2% in controls) suggested that the active CMV infection triggers a cellular immune response. This was also supported by a high frequency of CMV-specific interferon-gamma-producing T cells in CMV-seropositive patients with AD.
Our data suggest that active, subclinical CMV infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe AD and may have immunopathophysiological relevance."

Interleukin-10 therapy--review of a new approach.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine produced by many cell populations. Its main biological function seems to be the limitation and termination of inflammatory responses and the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of several immune cells such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, antigen-presenting cells, mast cells, and granulocytes. However, very recent data suggest IL-10 also mediates immunostimulatory properties that help to eliminate infectious and noninfectious particles with limited inflammation. Numerous investigations, including expression analyses in patients, in vitro and animal experiments suggest a major impact of IL-10 in inflammatory, malignant, and autoimmune diseases. So IL-10 overexpression was found in certain tumors as melanoma and several lymphomas and is considered to promote further tumor development. Systemic IL-10 release is a powerful tool of the central nervous system to prevent hyperinflammatory processes by activation of the neuro-endocrine axis following acute stress reactions. In contrast, a relative IL-10 deficiency has been observed and is regarded to be of pathophysiological relevance in certain inflammatory disorders characterized by a type 1 cytokine pattern such as psoriasis. Recombinant human IL-10 has been produced and is currently being tested in clinical trials. This includes rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, organ transplantation, and chronic hepatitis C. The results are heterogeneous. They give new insight into the immunobiology of IL-10 and suggest that the IL-10/IL-10 receptor system may become a new therapeutic target.

Different modes of IL-10 and TGF-beta to inhibit cytokine-dependent IFN-gamma production: consequences for reversal of lipopolysaccharide desensitization.	LPS hyporesponsiveness is characterized by a diminished production of proinflammatory cytokines which can be caused by pretreatment with either LPS (=LPS desensitization) or the combination of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. However, the resulting hyporesponsive states differ regarding their reversibility by the IFN-gamma-inducing cytokine IL-12. Therefore, we aimed at studying the reasons for this differential IL-12 responsiveness of IFN-gamma-producing cells and its consequences for LPS hyporesponsiveness in more detail. In an in vitro IL-12/IL-18 responsiveness model, we demonstrated that IL-10, if permanently present, does not directly inhibit IL-12/IL-18 responsiveness in T/NK cells but indirectly interferes with IFN-gamma production in the presence of monocytes. In contrast, TGF-beta acted directly on IFN-gamma-producing cells by interfering with IL-12/IL-18 responsiveness. After removal of IL-10 but not of TGF-beta, LPS hyporesponsiveness can be reverted by IL-12/IL-18. Consequently, the addition of recombinant TGF-beta during LPS desensitization rendered PBMCs hyporesponsive to a reversal by IL-12/IL-18. Our data suggest that the persistence of IL-10 and the presence of TGF-beta determine the level of IFN-gamma inhibition and may result in different functional phenotypes of LPS desensitization and LPS hyporesponsiveness in vitro and in vivo.

Mapping T cell epitopes by flow cytometry.	Epitope mapping by flow cytometry is a very modern approach that not only identifies T-cell epitopes but simultaneously allows for detailed analysis of the responding T-cell subsets including lineage, activation marker expression, and other markers of interest. The most frequently used approach is based on the identification of intracellular cytokines in secretion-inhibited activated T cells following stimulation with peptides or peptide pools. A more recently developed assay analyzes T-cell proliferation by measuring the decrease in carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining in proliferated cells. This article includes information on peptide configuration, a section on the design and efficient application of peptide pools, and working laboratory protocols for both assays.

Standardized immune monitoring for the prediction of infections after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in risk patients.	"Infections are the most common cause of late complications in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery patients, and are difficult to predict. Here we studied the diagnostic value of a standardized immune monitoring program based on recent advances in flow cytometry (exact quantification of surface-marker expression) and cytokine determination (semiautomatic systems).
CPB patients (56) at risk for complications (age >70 years and/or preoperative left-ventricular ejection fraction < 25 %) were classified into three groups: without (33), with suspected (14), and with confirmed (9) infection. Applying the Quantibrite trade mark -system, we daily quantified the expression of CD11b, CD64, CD71, CD86, and HLA-DR on monocytes/granulocytes. Furthermore, the ex vivo secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as well as the plasma interleukin (IL)-10 levels were determined by a semiautomatic system. Ex vivo elastase release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
All patients showed signs of granulocyte activation and monocyte deactivation. Monocytic HLA-DR and plasma IL-10 were the best markers to discriminate patients with infection from those without as early as day 1. Using a cutoff of 5792 HLA-DR molecules per cell, both sensitivity and negative predictive value for patients who developed microbiologically confirmed infection was 1.0, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85.
Our data suggest that a standardized immune monitoring at day 1 might be useful for early discrimination of patients at elevated risk for infections."	Cytometry.

Keratinocyte unresponsiveness towards interleukin-10: lack of specific binding due to deficient IL-10 receptor 1 expression.	Whereas the effects of interleukin (IL)-10 on several epithelial cell types are well established the capability of IL-10 to target keratinocytes (KC) is still a matter of debate. This, however, is of considerable importance, as IL-10 is a major anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive cytokine with impact on the cutaneous homeostasis. Recently, IL-10 therapy has been proven to be clinically effective in psoriasis. Response to therapy is associated with normalization of typical parameters of keratinocyte pathology, but it is unclear whether this results from direct or indirect (secondary) effects. The purpose of the present study was to further investigate direct effects of IL-10 on keratinocytes and to address the reason for potential IL-10 unresponsiveness using keratinocytes such as the cell line HaCaT as well as primary foreskin keratinocytes. Using real time RT-PCR we demonstrated that IL-10 is neither able to induce its typical early gene product suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3 nor to modulate the interferone (IFN)-gamma-induced expression of SOCS 1 and 3. Although flow cytometric analyses showed binding of biotin labelled IL-10 to HaCaT cells, blocking experiments indicated that this resulted from unspecific binding. Moreover, scatchard plot analyses excluded specific binding to primary KC and HaCaT cells. Finally, real time mRNA analyses and Western blot experiments demonstrated that the absence of any specific binding results from the absence of clear IL-10R1 (alpha chain) expression, whereas the IL-10R2 (beta chain) is strongly expressed. Our data indicates that IL-10 unresponsiveness of keratinocytes could be explained by the lacking of functional IL-10 receptor expression and suggest that any IL-10 effects on these cells observed are indirectly mediated.

Multiple mechanisms of reduced major histocompatibility complex class II expression in endotoxin tolerance.	Patients after polytrauma, burns, or septic shock frequently develop a life-threatening immunodeficiency. This state is associated with specific functional alterations of monocytic cells. We previously proposed endotoxin tolerance, the monocyte state after acute response to lipopolysaccharide, as a respective model system. One major feature in both the clinical situation and the in vitro model is the dramatic down-regulation of monocyte major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II surface expression, which is associated with impaired antigen presentation capacity. This study focused on the mechanisms behind reduced MHC class II expression in endotoxin tolerance. Endotoxin priming provoked a decrease of monocyte intracellular MHC class II. It also led to a reduced expression of the chaperonic invariant chain and to an inhibited synthesis of the major lysosomal enzyme for final cleavage of the invariant chain going along with a relative accumulation of p10. The expression of HLA-DM necessary for loading MHC class II with antigenic peptide was also decreased. Additionally, reduced export of MHC class II alphabeta complexes to the cell surface was observed. The down-regulation of HLA-DR, invariant chain, and HLA-DM was regulated at the mRNA level and may be the consequence of reduced class II transactivator expression observed in this study. The simultaneous interference at different regulatory levels may explain the uniquely strong and long lasting MHC class II down-modulating effect of endotoxin priming compared with transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-10. These results not only contribute to a better understanding of experimental endotoxin tolerance but may also give rise to new therapeutics for temporary immunodeficiency and, conversely, for MHC class II-dependent diseases such as autoimmunity and transplant rejection.

[Adoptive transfer of Epstein-Barr virus-specific T-lymphocytes in chronic active Epstein-Barr infection].	"A 27-year-old man was admitted because of intermittent fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly for 20 years. Chronic administration of 6 - 8 g aspirin per day (self-prescribed) resulted in limited control of symptoms and in the development of analgesic nephropathy.
The patient had prominent splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy without histological signs of malignancy. Monocytosis and T-lymphopenia were also present. Infectious disease testing revealed IgG+/IgM- EBV serology and EA-EBV-mRNA nested PCR clearly demonstrated the presence of lytic EBV-proteins in PBMCs.
As chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) was highly probable, treatment with aciclovir, gancilovir and steroids was started. Because treatment failed adoptive T-cell transfer with autologous EBV-specific T-cells was performed. After three consecutive infusions the patient responded with a complete remission of fever, fatigue, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly without adverse effects. Retrospective real-time PCR analysis showed a decrease in viral load from 62847 copies/ microg DNA to 45 - 250 copies after treatment.

Comparison of proliferation and rapid cytokine induction assays for flow cytometric T-cell epitope mapping.	"T-cell epitope mapping by flow cytometry based on rapid ex vivo peptide-specific cytokine induction in T cells is very efficient and time saving compared with traditional assays. We investigated whether the same epitopes could be identified by proliferation studies.
An assay based on rapid interferon-gamma induction in T cells (6 h of ex vivo stimulation) was run in parallel with a proliferation assay based on the incremental loss of carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining in proliferating cells. The proliferation assay was chosen because it can be evaluated by high-resolution modern multiparameter flow cytometry. In both cases, T cells were stimulated with the same cytomegalovirus-derived peptides. The peptides identified by the rapid induction of interferon-gamma were compared with those inducing T-cell proliferation.
Most epitopes were identified by proliferation and rapid cytokine induction methods; however, each method also identified epitopes that the other one did not. In general, rapid cytokine induction was associated with considerably less background noise, making epitope identification easier, and, owing to the short stimulation time necessary, several identification steps could be carried out on material stored in the incubator.
Even though most epitopes were identified by both approaches, the rapid cytokine induction method had major logistic advantages. However, it may be best to use both assays, particularly in situations in which the identification of epitopes may depend on prior clonal T-cell expansion."	Cytometry.

Experimental therapies for psoriasis.	There is a high medical need for better therapies for psoriasis. Based on new insight into the pathophysiology of this frequent immune disease, a number of novel systemic immunomodulatory therapies are currently in clinical development. These include approaches targeting antigen presentation and costimulation, T cell activation and leukocyte adhesion, action of proinflammatory mediators, and modulating the cytokine balance. Although mainly only preliminary data are available so far, these trials contribute to a further understanding of the disease and will eventually lead to new therapeutic options for psoriasis. Moreover, since psoriasis can be considered as a visible model disease for T cell-mediated disorders characterized by a type 1 cytokine pattern in general, such approaches may have impact for other immune disorders as well. Here we review the rationale and the initial clinical data of these important recent experimental therapies.

Differences in immune cell invasion into the cerebrospinal fluid and brain parenchyma during cerebral infusion of interleukin-1beta.	Cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell recruitment into the brain is a critical step in the response to diverse insults, including infection, trauma, and stroke. Hence, continous intra-cerebroventricular infusion of interleukin (IL)-1beta leads to an impressive cell invasion into the cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the brain parenchyma. Neither tumor necrosis factor-alpha nor IL-6 induced any significant cell invasion at all. However, the diverse immune cells (granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages) showed a different time course of invasion. Moreover, there was an association between the number of infiltrating immune cells and the infused IL-1 concentration. By analyzing intra-brain immune events, we demonstrated a time- and dose-dependent induction of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, whereas there were no differences for P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, and monocyte-chemotractant protein (MCP)-1, comparing vehicle and IL-1-infused animals. In conclusion, we assume IL-1beta to be a key cytokine for the granulocyte and monocyte recruitment into the central nervous system after various insults. However, granulocytes anticipate monocyte invasion.

Fumaric acid esters are potent immunosuppressants: inhibition of acute and chronic rejection in rat kidney transplantation models by methyl hydrogen fumarate.	The effectiveness and safety of fumaric acid esters (FAEs) for the treatment of psoriasis has been demonstrated. Their mode of action, however, is poorly understood. To determine the immunomodulatory potential of calcium methyl hydrogen fumarate (CaMHF) in transplant models, we tested the compound in rat transplantation models of acute rejection (AR) and chronic rejection (CR). Orthotopic kidney transplantation was combined with contralateral nephrectomy using the strain combinations WF to BDIX (AR) and F344 to LEW (CR). Recipients were treated orally prophylactically (day -28 to day +28, AR and CR model) or therapeutically (day +30 to day +60, CR model). CaMHF significantly prolonged the time to onset of AR in the WF/BDIX model. The half-lives of the grafts were 14 days in the CaMHF group, 7 days in the placebo-treated control group and 9 days in the untreated control group ( P<0.01). Three of ten CaMHF-treated rats showed permanent graft acceptance (defined as survival for >100 days) resulting in a mean survival time of >42.3+/-41.0 ( P<0.01) in comparison with >28.3+/-38.3 days in the placebo-treated group and 9.4+/-2.6 days in the untreated control group. In the F344/LEW model of chronic graft injury, only prophylactic CaMHF treatment significantly inhibited the development of CR ( P=0.001; mean survival times >28.4+/-2.0 weeks, >23.9+/-6.0 weeks and >21.1+/-5.4 weeks in the prophylactic CaMHF, therapeutic CaMHF, and placebo group, respectively). By 30 weeks six of ten prophylactically treated animals were still alive, but only three of nine and one of ten were alive in the therapeutically treated and placebo-treated groups, respectively ( P<0.05). These findings indicate that CaMHF treatment effectively inhibits AR and CR, and demonstrates marked in vivo immunomodulatory efficacy. Thus, FAEs should be considered as drugs showing considerable immunosuppressive efficacy. This might have implications with regard to safety issues (e.g. immune monitoring) and novel potentially suitable indications (e.g. transplantation and other immune diseases).

Targeting of macrophage activity by adenovirus-mediated intragraft overexpression of TNFRp55-Ig, IL-12p40, and vIL-10 ameliorates adenovirus-mediated chronic graft injury, whereas stimulation of macrophages by overexpression of IFN-gamma accelerates chronic graft injury in a rat renal allograft model.	Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene transfer of immunoregulatory molecules prevents acute allograft rejection. It is here analyzed for the first time whether this approach may prevent the development of chronic renal allograft injury in rats. Renal allografts (F344-->Lewis rat) were ex vivo transduced in group I with control Ad-construct, group II with three different therapeutic Ad-constructs expressing the immunoregulatory molecules vIL-10, TNFRp55-Ig, and IL-12p40, and group III with AdIFN-gamma. Group IV served as untreated controls. Control grafts (IV) showed increasing proteinuria during the 24-wk follow-up. Chronic graft injury was accelerated by Ad-control (I) and even more by AdIFN-gamma (III). All rats carrying the AdIFN-gamma-transduced grafts died within 12 to 13 wk by advanced chronic renal failure associated with strong immune cell infiltration and immune gene expression. By contrast, the Ad-therapy group II showed less inflammation and improved graft histology and function if compared with the groups I and III. Moreover, significantly less infiltrating ED-1(+) macrophages and an improved histologic score even if compared with untreated controls (IV) was observed. However, after disappearance of therapeutic gene expression, group II showed increasing proteinuria probably as result of late T cell activation to the Ad-encoded proteins. Ex vivo transduction of allografts with Ad-control or even more AdIFN-gamma expression promotes intragraft inflammation and chronic graft injury. Targeting macrophage activation by a cocktail of therapeutic genes improved the results. These data support the pathogenetic role of cytokines in chronic graft injury; however, they also show the limitations of the Ad-mediated gene transfer.

NF-kappaB--a potential therapeutic target for inhibition of human cytomegalovirus (re)activation?	From clinical studies the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha was proposed to play a key role in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation from latency. In vitro experiments confirmed that TNFalpha stimulates the activity of the HCMV IE1/2 enhancer/promoter, which controls immediate early protein IE1 and IE2 gene expression via activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its binding to putative binding sites in the IE1/2 enhancer. NF-kappaB was also proposed to be involved in IE1-mediated autostimulation of this promoter. The IE1/2 enhancer of HCMV contains four putative NF-kappaB binding sites which differ in their distance to the transcription start site as well as in their sequence. Construction and testing of a series of promoter mutants demonstrated that NF-kappaB is essential for both TNFalpha and IE1 stimulation. Furthermore, we were able to show that although all four NF-kappaB sites bind NF-kappaB with similar affinity in vitro, the contribution to TNFalpha and IE1 stimulation differs in correlation with the distance to the transcription start site and the sequence. Site 1 and 3 play the most dominant role and site 2 an intermediate, while site 4, which is conserved in sequence but far distant from the transcription start site, had no influence on NF-kappaB-mediated regulation of the IE1/2 promoter. Specific inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling by co-expression of a dominant-negative IkappaB variant reduced TNFalpha stimulation of the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter by up to 80%. From this data, inhibitors of NF-kappaB activation are suggested to be an alternative therapeutical strategy to interfere with HCMV (re)activation in undifferentiated monocyte/granulocyte progenitor cells in patients with a high risk of inflammation-related HCMV (re)activation.

[Immunomodulation in sepsis].	"The systemic inflammatory response syndrome is induced by a strong inflammatory reaction which is called sepsis when it is caused by an infection. However, anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies in septic patients were not successful, indicating a more complex system. It is now clear that systemic hyper-inflammation induces systemic anti- or hypo-inflammation which can lead to total paralysis of the immune system (""immunoparalysis"").
Several studies were performed to evaluate parameters for describing the patient's immunocompetence. Based on these parameters, pilot trials were initiated to test immunomodulating therapies depending on the patient's immunocompetence.
The measurement of monocytic HLA-DR expression, as well as the measurement of ex vivo LPS-induced TNF-a secretion, are suitable to describe the patient's immunocompetence. In addition to classical inflammation markers, the characterization of the inflammatory and infection status is completed by measurement of the plasma cytokines, LBP and PCT. IFN-g or GM-CSF application as well as the removal of inhibitory plasma mediators by hemofiltration/plasmapheresis can reconstitute the immune function in patients with ""immunoparalysis"".
Immunomodulating therapeutic strategies in septic patients have to orientate on the patient's immunocompetence and inflammatory as well as infectious status: a patient in a hyper-inflammatory phase may need anti-inflammatory therapy whereas a patient in ""immunoparalysis"" needs immunoreconstitution/immunostimulating therapy."

"Immunologic and hemodynamic effects of ""low-dose"" hydrocortisone in septic shock: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study."	Within the last few years, increasing evidence of relative adrenal insufficiency in septic shock evoked a reassessment of hydrocortisone therapy. To evaluate the effects of hydrocortisone on the balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammation, 40 patients with septic shock were randomized in a double-blind crossover study to receive either the first 100 mg of hydrocortisone as a loading dose and 10 mg per hour until Day 3 (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20), followed by the opposite medication until Day 6. Hydrocortisone infusion induced an increase of mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and a decline of heart rate, cardiac index, and norepinephrine requirement. A reduction of plasma nitrite/nitrate indicated inhibition of nitric oxide formation and correlated with a reduction of vasopressor support. The inflammatory response (interleukin-6 and interleukin-8), endothelial (soluble E-selectin) and neutrophil activation (expression of CD11b, CD64), and antiinflammatory response (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II and interleukin-10) were attenuated. In peripheral blood monocytes, human leukocyte antigen-DR expression was only slightly depressed, whereas in vitro phagocytosis and the monocyte-activating cytokine interleukin-12 increased. Hydrocortisone withdrawal induced hemodynamic and immunologic rebound effects. In conclusion, hydrocortisone therapy restored hemodynamic stability and differentially modulated the immunologic response to stress in a way of antiinflammation rather than immunosuppression.

Heme oxygenase 1 mediates the immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic effects of interleukin 13 gene therapy in vivo and in vitro.	"This study analyzes mechanisms by which interleukin 13 (IL-13) affects ""infectious tolerance"" in rat recipients of cardiac allografts, with emphasis on interactions between intragraft Ad-IL-13 gene transfer and systemic infusion of regulatory cells. Although exogenous viral IL-13 was modestly effective on its own, adjunctive Ad-IL-13 gene therapy and adoptive transfer of suboptimal dose of regulatory T cells exerted synergistic effects, as evidenced by long-term cardiac allograft survival in test recipients. Local IL-13 induction (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistology) diminished intragraft apoptosis, and upregulated antiapoptotic A20 and antioxidant heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Ad-IL-13 plus regulatory cells synergistically diminished the frequency of cells positive by TUNEL (TdT [terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase]-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) assay, and enhanced cytoprotective gene expression. These findings correlated with in vitro studies in which Ad-IL-13 decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated cytotoxicity, conferred resistance to apoptosis, and increased HO-1/A20 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures. However, inhibition of HO-1 after treatment with tin protoporphyrin reversed the immunomodulatory/antiapoptotic effects of Ad-IL-13 both in vivo (infectious transplantation tolerance), and in vitro (HUVECs). Thus, by decreasing apoptosis/TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity, and by facilitating induction of antiapoptotic/antioxidant molecules in HUVECs, this study documents the cytoprotective function of Ad-IL-13 in vitro, and points toward in vivo synergy between Ad-IL-13 and regulatory cells in the infectious transplantation tolerance pathway. Results of HO-1 neutralization studies suggest that HO-1 represents one of the putative IL-13 downstream effectors."

Autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific cytotoxic T cells for the treatment of persistent active EBV infection.	Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) infection syndrome is a heterogeneous EBV-related disorder characterized by chronic fatigue, fever, lymphadenopathy, and/or hepatosplenomegaly, associated with abnormal patterns of antibody to EBV. CAEBV can range from disabling mild/moderate forms to rapidly lethal disorders. Even patients with mild/moderate disease frequently suffer adverse effects from long-term anti-inflammatory agents and have a quality of life that progressively deteriorates. It is still unknown why these individuals are unable to produce an effective immune response to control EBV, and no effective treatment is currently available. Since ex vivo-expanded EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (EBV-CTLs) can safely restore EBV-specific cellular immune responses in immunodeficient patients, we assessed the possibility that adoptive immunotherapy might also effectively treat CAEBV infection. Following stimulation with irradiated EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), EBV-CTLs were successfully generated from 8 of 8 patients with the mild/moderate form of CAEBV infection. These CTLs were predominantly CD3(+) CD8(+) cells and produced specific killing of the autologous LCLs. There were 5 patients with 1- to 12-year histories of disease who were treated with 1 to 4 injections of EBV-CTLs. Following infusion, there was resolution of fatigue and malaise, disappearance of fever, and regression of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. The pattern and titers of anti-EBV antibodies also normalized. No toxicity was observed. There were 4 patients who did not show any relapse of disease within 6 to 36 months follow-up; one patient had recurrence of fatigue and myalgia one year after CTL infusion. We suggest that adoptive immunotherapy with autologous EBV-CTLs may represent a safe and feasible alternative treatment for patients affected with mild/moderate CAEBV infection and that this approach should be evaluated in the more severe forms of the disease.

Immune monitoring of glucocorticoid therapy.	There is a clear medical need to improve the GC therapy because of the individually variable responsiveness to GC. Recently, several well-standardised cell-based assays focussing on monocyte functions (flowcytometric measurement of HLA-DR expression, semiautomatic measurement of ex vivo TNF release capacity) have been introduced into the clinical laboratory. These techniques allow for both the detection immunosuppression and the monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. The measurement of efficacy might be further improved by applying the novel technology of gene expression profiling that is ready for introducing into the diagnostics.

Inhibition of ischemia/reperfusion injury and chronic graft deterioration by a single-donor treatment with cobalt-protoporphyrin for the induction of heme oxygenase-1.	Today, the major problem in organ transplantation is not acute graft rejection but chronic graft deterioration. In addition to alloantigen-specific events, alloantigen independent factors like donor age, previous diseases, consequences of brain death, and perioperative events of ischemia/reperfusion injury have a major impact on long-term graft function. The induction of the stress protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protects cells from injury and apoptosis. Here, we tested the protective effects of HO-1 induction in a clinically relevant kidney transplant model. Induction of HO-1 expression following cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPP) treatment in organ donors prolonged graft survival and long-term function remarkably following extended periods of ischemia. Positive effects were observed with both optimal and marginal grafts from old donor animals. Structural changes characteristic for chronic rejection, as well as graft infiltration by monocytes/macrophages and CD8+ T cells, were substantially reduced following HO-1 induction. Up-regulation of HO-1 expression before organ transplantation was also associated with reduced levels for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA, increased levels for interferon (IFN)-gamma, and bcl-x, and insignificant differences for CD25, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA levels. The significant improvement of long-term graft function following induction of HO-1 expression in donor organs suggests that this strategy may be a novel clinical treatment option with particular relevance for transplantation of marginal organs.

Analysis of cytokine expression in dermatology.	During the past decade, the detection of cytokines has been a focus of scientific interest, including in dermatology. Dysregulation of cytokine production seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The determination of cytokine levels is of increasing diagnostic importance, and cytokines are used as therapeutic agents too. Cytokines are polypeptides secreted by a wide variety of cells in response to diverse stimuli, and mediate autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine effects that are often pleiotropic and redundant. Their molecular weight lies between 6 and 70 kd. The cytokines of immunologic relevance are primarily those that are formed by immune cells (monokines and lymphokines) and/or influence their function. In principle, cytokines are detectable on 3 levels: (1) By using polymerase chain reaction, the messenger RNA expression of cytokine genes can be detected and, with the newer techniques, even quantified. (2) Protein synthesis can be detected by using bioassays and enzyme immunoassays or immunocytologic or immunohistologic detection of intracellular cytokine production. (3) Finally, there are indirect methods for the detection of cytokine formation by analysis of products of cytokine activity. The immunobiological features of cytokines and the different approaches for cytokine determination are briefly discussed herein because basic knowledge of these biologically highly active messenger substances and the capabilities and limits of the individual detection methods are essential for a sensible interpretation of the relevant findings.

Upregulation of Bag-1 by ex vivo gene transfer protects rat livers from ischemia/reperfusion injury.	Bag-1 exerts powerful antiapoptotic effects by binding and stabilizing Bcl-2 and interacting with the tumor necrosis factor receptor type I-induced death signal. We examined the effects of overexpression of Bag-1 by ex vivo adenoviral gene transfer on cold (4 degrees C for 24 hr) ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of rat livers. Treatment with adenoviral Bag-1 (Ad-Bag-1) significantly improved portal venous blood flow, increased bile production, and improved hepatic function in the ex vivo model of cold ischemia followed by isolated perfusion. Moreover, the survival of orthotopic liver grafts subjected to cold ischemia increased from 50% in Ad-betaGal-treated controls to 100% after Ad-Bag-1 therapy. This effect correlated with preserved hepatic architecture, improved liver function, and depressed infiltration by neutrophils. Furthermore, the activation of infiltrating T cells, as measured by CD25, IL-2, and IFN-gamma mRNA expression was markedly reduced in the Ad-Bag-1 group. Hence, gene therapy-induced Bag-1 overexpression prevented cold I/R injury in rat livers. These findings provide the rationale for refined novel treatment of donor livers and may ultimately improve the overall success of liver transplantation.

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (rPSGL-Ig)-mediated blockade of CD62 selectin molecules protects rat steatotic liver grafts from ischemia/reperfusion injury.	We examined the effects of early blockade of CD62 selectin-mediated adhesive interactions in steatotic rat liver models of ex vivo cold ischemia followed by reperfusion or transplantation by administration of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (rPSGL-Ig). In the model of cold ischemia/reperfusion, livers pretreated ex vivo with rPSGL-Ig at harvesting from obese Zucker rats showed significantly decreased portal resistance, increased bile production, and diminished hepatic endothelial neutrophil infiltration, as compared with untreated controls. Pretreatment of fatty livers with rPSGL-Ig prior to transplantation extended the survival of lean Zucker rat recipients from 40% to 90%. This effect correlated with significantly improved liver function, depressed neutrophil activity, and decreased histologic features of hepatocyte injury. Intragraft expression of CD62 P-selectin was similar in both recipient groups. rPSGL-Ig treatment decreased intragraft infiltration by CD3/CD25 cells, diminished expression of pro-inflammatory TNFalpha, IL-6, iNOS, IL-2 and IFN-gamma, without significantly affecting mRNA levels coding for anti-inflammatory IL-4. Thus, rPSGL-Ig blockade of CD62-mediated adhesive interactions protects against severe ischemia/reperfusion injury suffered otherwise by steatotic rat livers. These findings document the potential utility of rPSGL-Ig in increasing the transplant donor pool through modulation of marginal steatotic livers.

Bag-1 up-regulation in anti-CD4 mAb-treated allo-activated T cell confers resistance to activation-induced cell death (AICD).	The non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) RIB5/2 is a powerful inducer of tolerance to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-incompatible allografts in rat recipients. The unresponsiveness induced is characterized by the persistence (over 300 days) of donor-reactive regulatory T cells within the graft. We applied differential-display reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify differences at the mRNA level between graft-infiltrating cells of anti-CD4 mAb-treated and non-treated control rats at day 5 after kidney transplantation. A 550-bp DNA fragment appearing only in anti-CD4 mAb-treated rats is identical with the anti-apoptotic protein Bag-1. A further investigation of Bag-1 expression during mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) revealed a three-four-fold up-regulation of Bag-1 mRNA expression in anti-CD4 mAb-treated allogeneic cultures. Bag-1 up-regulation is associated with higher protection against apoptosis of anti-CD4 mAb-treated cultures. Application of antisense oligonucleotides specific for Bag-1 leads to both a reduction in Bag-1 expression and sensibility against apoptosis. Thus, the expression of Bag-1 in anti-CD4 mAb-treated alloreactive T cells conferred resistance against apoptosis, which may contribute to the long-term survival of tolerance-mediating T cells in vivo.

Efficient in vitro transduction of epithelial cells and keratinocytes with improved adenoviral gene transfer for the application in skin tissue engineering.	The adenovirus-mediated transfer of therapeutic genes into keratinocytes may be a useful approach to treat several skin diseases or to improve the graft take of in vitro generated skin equivalents used for wound coverage. However, in contrast to many other tissues, keratinocytes are relatively difficult to transduce by adenoviral vectors. To achieve high efficiency of adenoviral transduction into epithelial cells we investigated the effects of the polycation polybrene on the infection process. The human (HaCaT, A549) and rat (NBT II, MHICI) epithelial cell lines, as well as human and rat primary keratinocytes, were transduced with recombinant Ad(beta)-gal adenovirus, encoding for the reporter gene E. coli beta-galactosidase, in the presence of various polybrene concentrations. We determined the amount of beta-gal positive cells by X-gal staining and the beta-gal expression by ONPG-assay after 24 h. In all tested human and rat epithelial cell lines, as well as in human and rat primary keratinocytes, the addition of polybrene during adenoviral transduction of Ad(beta)-gal resulted in a marked increase of beta-gal positive cells and beta-gal protein expression. The efficacy of polybrene showed a clear dose dependency. The improvement of adenoviral gene transfer into various types of human and rat epithelial cells by polybrene allows us to reduce the amount of recombinant virus particles resulting in a decreased inflammation induced by this therapeutic agent. In addition, the efficient transduction and expression with enhanced adenoviral transfer of therapeutic genes into primary keratinocytes provides a powerful tool for analysing the functions and the regulation of a gene of interest in vitro.

Abnormalities of pulmonary diffusion capacity in long-term survivors after kidney transplantation.	"Alterations in pulmonary function and interstitial changes in the lungs of renal transplant recipients have been described, but prospective longitudinal data are lacking.
A prospective analysis of pulmonary function tests and pulmonary CT in renal transplant recipients in stable condition at two different time points following kidney transplantation (KT).
Seventy-nine renal transplant recipients in stable condition were included. The first studies were performed 83 months (median) following KT. In 36 of these patients, it was possible to obtain a second set of studies after an additional follow-up period of 22 months.
Approximately 11% of all patients showed significant restrictive and obstructive abnormalities in pulmonary function tests. In the majority of transplant recipients, considerable defects in pulmonary diffusion capacity were documented: lung transfer factor for carbon monoxide, or transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide were < 80% of the predicted value in 57% and 76%, respectively. In 24% of the CT studies, substantial interstitial alterations were found. However, no significant correlations could be established between CT morphology and the presence of diffusion abnormalities. At the time of the second follow-up investigation, we found a further decrease in diffusion capacity in approximately 30% of patients despite an unchanged CT morphology in most of these patients.
We conclude that an impairment of pulmonary diffusion capacity exists in the majority of long-term survivors after KT. In our opinion, CT-detectable interstitial findings do not represent a causative factor for these abnormalities. A plausible hypothesis is a ""low-grade pulmonary microvascular injury"" in combination with a long-term decrease in pulmonary perfusion. The impact of these diffusion defects on symptomatology and prognosis in kidney transplant recipients is largely unclear, and further studies are needed."

Cachexia: a therapeutic approach beyond cytokine antagonism.	Cachexia is seen in a number of chronic diseases, and it is always associated with a poor prognosis. Irrespective of etiology, the development of cachexia appears to share a common pathophysiological pathway. This includes induction of proteasome-dependent myofibril-degradation, which is thought to be secondary to stimulation by enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Elevation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and other plasma cytokines has been demonstrated in many conditions associated with cachexia. Despite improved pathophysiological understanding, a specific treatment for cachexia has not yet been established. Whilst direct TNFalpha antagonism has therapeutic appeal, this review will focus on manipulation of downstream pathways and the potential benefits. For example, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is one of the most important signal transducers of TNFalpha, and drugs targeting this signalling cascade might be useful in the treatment of cachexia. Although the use of some of these substances, for example glucocorticoids, remains controversial, others may prove beneficial in the treatment of this syndrome. The role of other approaches such as proteasome-inhibitors remains to be elucidated. Alternatively, interleukin-10 and other immunosuppressive cytokines may also be able to counterbalance certain features of cachexia.

Heme oxygenase-1 gene transfer inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and protects genetically fat Zucker rat livers from ischemia-reperfusion injury.	"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a critical factor in the dysfunction of steatotic orthotopic liver transplants. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective protein, may be important in ameliorating hepatic I/R injury.
We used adenovirus (Ad)-based HO-1 gene transfer to analyze the effects of HO-1 overexpression in a well-established fatty Zucker rat model of I/R followed by orthotopic liver transplantation.
Ad-HO-1 gene therapy increased recipient survival (80% vs. 40-50% in controls) and significantly diminished hepatocyte injury, as compared with untreated and Ad-beta-galactosidase (Ad-beta-Gal)-treated livers. Orthotopic liver transplants in the Ad-HO-1 group exhibited less macrophage infiltration in the portal areas, as compared with controls. Unlike untreated and Ad-beta-Gal-treated orthotopic liver transplant controls, which showed elevated levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase by infiltrating macrophages, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the Ad-HO-1 group was almost absent. In contrast, endothelial nitric oxide synthase was comparable in Ad-HO-1- and Ad-beta-Gal-transduced fatty orthotopic liver transplants. Intragraft expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bag-1 was increased in Ad-HO-1-treated orthotopic liver transplants, as compared with Ad-beta-Gal controls. Moreover, increased HO enzymatic activity was accompanied by inhibition of caspase-3 protein expression.
HO-1 gene transfer significantly prolongs survival of steatotic orthotopic liver transplants, depresses macrophage infiltration, suppresses local expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, and modulates pro- and antiapoptotic pathways."

Heme oxygenase 1 gene transfer prevents CD95/Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis and improves liver allograft survival via carbon monoxide signaling pathway.	Apoptosis via the CD95/FasL (CD95L) pathway plays an important role in allograft rejection. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a stress-responsive cytoprotective molecule, may be essential in preventing graft rejection. We used Ad-HO-1 gene transfer to analyze HO-1-mediated effects in a rat allogeneic orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) model. The cytotoxicity to Fas-bearing YAC-1 target cells and frequency of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive (TUNEL(+)) cells in vitro were diminished in Ad-CD95L + Ad-HO-1-transfected cells, as compared with Ad-CD95L + Ad-beta-gal controls (p < 0.001). AdHO-1 gene transfer prevented <10-day rejection of dark agouti (DA) livers in Lewis (LEW) rats (survival >32 days), and diminished apoptosis. Unlike Ad-beta-gal OLTs, which showed signs of severe acute rejection, OLTs in the Ad-HO-1 group exhibited mild to moderate rejection and improved function. These beneficial effects were abrogated after adjunctive treatment with tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), an HO-1 antagonist. Intragraft expression of HO-1 and antiapoptotic gene products (Bcl-xl/Bag-1) was enhanced in Ad-HO-1-transduced OLTs, in association with selectively depressed expression of helper T cell type 1 cytokines (interleukin 2 and interferon gamma), as compared with Ad-beta-gal controls. To deliver CO, one of the downstream HO-1 mediators, allogeneic OLT recipients were exposed to methylene chloride. Such treatment prolonged survival to >47 days, diminished apoptosis, and preserved hepatic architecture/function. Thus, Ad-HO-1 gene transfer prevents CD95/FasL-mediated apoptosis, and significantly prolongs allogeneic OLT survival via a downstream HO-1-CO signaling pathway.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphoprotein 65 makes a large contribution to shaping the T cell repertoire in CMV-exposed individuals.	Antigen-specific, cytokine flow cytometry was used to analyze the prevalence and frequency of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells specific for the abundantly expressed cytomegalovirus (CMV) phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) in healthy CMV IgG-seropositive individuals. Stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with peptide pools and individual peptides derived from the pp65 amino acid sequence in 40 donors revealed that 63% of donors had a detectable CD4 T cell response and that 83% of donors had a detectable CD8 T cell response against this protein. The overall frequencies of T cells directed against pp65 were analyzed for 20 donors by stimulation with peptide pools covering the complete pp65 protein and were as high as 2 in 1000 and 9 in 1000 (median) peripheral blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, respectively. In addition, a comparison between CD4 responses to a CMV lysate containing various CMV proteins and pp65-specific responses in 9 donors indicated that pp65 was a dominant target of the CMV-specific CD4 T cell response in some, but not all, donors. Several new T cell epitopes were identified.

Vitamin E deficiency sensitizes alveolar type II cells for apoptosis.	Pre-term neonates and neonates in general exhibit physiological vitamin E deficiency and are at increased risk for the development of acute lung diseases. Apoptosis is a major cause of acute lung damage in alveolar type II cells. In this paper, we evaluated the hypothesis that vitamin E deficiency predisposes alveolar type II cells to apoptosis. Therefore, we measured markers of apoptosis in alveolar type II cells isolated from control rats, vitamin E deficient rats and deficient rats that were re-fed a vitamin E-enriched diet. Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c increased, and the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and Hsp25 expression was reduced in vitamin E deficiency. Furthermore, increased DNA-fragmentation and numbers of early and late apoptotic cells were seen, but caspases 3 and 8 activities and expression of Fas, Bcl-2, Bcl-x and p53 remained unchanged. Vitamin E depletion did not change the GSH/GSSG ratio and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Thus, vitamin E deficiency may induce a reversible pro-apoptotic response in lung cells and sensitise them for additional insult. In agreement with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that in vivo hyperoxia alone does not induce apoptosis in type II cells of control rats but reversibly increases DNA-fragmentation and numbers of early apoptotic type II cells in vitamin E-depleted cells.

Immunomodulatory changes in patients with colorectal cancer.	"Solid tumors are frequently accompanied by a depressed cellular and humoral immunity. This study analyzed changes these factors in colorectal cancer patients.
We compared cellular (leukocytes, lymphocytes, HLA-DR expression on monocytes) and humoral immune parameters (interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha) in 40 patients with colorectal cancer and in 18 healthy controls.
Leukocytes were in the normal range in patients and controls. However, tumor patients showed significant lymphopenia in comparison to controls. HLA-DR antigen expression on CD14+ monocytes was reduced in the cancer patients while IL-6 and IL-10 plasma levels were increased. Patients with UICC stage III had IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were significantly increased as well.
These findings suggest that colorectal tumor establishment and progression results in a malfunction of the immune system, and underline the importance of elucidating in detail the mechanisms of immune modulation in cancer patients."

Oligodeoxynucleotides induce brain inflammation in rats when infused intracerebroventricularly.	Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can inhibit gene expression in a specific manner. However, several studies described problems with cerebral ODN application. Here, we investigated the immune effects (interleukin-6 (IL-6) release, cell invasion into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma) of 'non-sense' randomized ODNs with different counterions (NH(4)(+), Na(+)) and modifications (with or without thioat-backbone) which were administered intracerebroventricularly for 48 h using osmotic mini-pumps in a rat model. All animals receiving ODNs showed increased IL-6 levels in the CSF as well as cell invasion into the CSF and brain parenchyma (P<0.05). However, the use of thioat-backbone and ammonium as the counterion induced the highest IL-6 levels (7210+/-1696 pg/ml, P<0.05) and the highest cell numbers in the CSF (31.6+/-15.5x10(5)/ml, P<0.05) as well as brain parenchyma (268.1+/-143.2 HIS-48+ cells/mm(2), P<0.01; and 31.3+/-10.7 OX-6+cells/mm(2), P<0.05) compared with the other groups.

Intrabody-mediated phenotypic knockout of major histocompatibility complex class I expression in human and monkey cell lines and in primary human keratinocytes.	Cultured keratinocyte allografts from unrelated donors can be readily grown as sheets in large-scale cell culture and have been used as an immediate skin cover for severely burned patients. Despite the absence of passenger leukocytes and the unlimited amount of material that can be obtained for permanent skin coverage, the allografts are susceptible to rejection. Since MHC class I (MHCI) antigens serve as targets for allograft rejection, we investigated whether 'phenotypic knockout' of human MHCI could be achieved through expression of an ER-directed anti-human MHCI single-chain intrabody (sFvhMHCI) that is directed against a monomorphic, conformational epitope, expressed across species lines, on the MHCI heavy chain. Co-immunoprecipitation of both MHCI heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin occurred in transfected monkey COS-1 cells, while Jurkat T cells stably expressing the ER-directed sFvhMHCI intrabody showed that complete phenotypic knockout of MHCI cell surface expression could be achieved. Infection of several human cell lines of divergent tissue sources and different HLA haplotypes resulted in marked down-regulation of MHCI expression, even under conditions where inflammatory cytokines (eg gamma-IFN) which up-regulate MHCI expression were used. Finally, when adenovirus encoding the anti-human MHCI intrabody was used to transduce primary human keratinocytes, a marked reduction of surface MHCI expression was observed. These in vitro studies set the groundwork for in vivo studies to determine if intrabody-mediated knockout of MHCI can impair alloantigen expression and prolong the survival of keratinocyte allografts.

Blockade of CD40-CD154 at the time of donor-specific blood transfusion does not lead to prolonged kidney allograft survival in nonhuman primates.	"In rodents it has been demonstrated that blockade of the CD40-CD154 (CD40L) pathway at the time of donor-specific blood transfusion (DST) can result in indefinite graft survival. Because it has been reported in the past that DST in monkeys can have a favorable effect on graft outcome and that blockade of the CD40-CD154 pathway can lead to prolonged kidney graft survival in monkeys, we have combined anti-CD154 treatment with DST in a monkey kidney graft model. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunosuppressive potential of blocking the CD40-CD154 interaction at the time of a DST in rhesus monkeys.
One donor-derived blood transfusion was given on day -15 after the first anti-CD154 injection. The anti-CD154 antibody was given on days -15, -13, -11, -9, and -7. The kidney was transplanted on day 0. Cyclosporine was given after kidney trans-plantation.
No major difference in graft survival was observed between the groups. The animals died due to grade II acute rejection. At the time of transplantation, no antibody response could be detected directed against donor antigens. After transplantation, all animals surviving for more than 3 weeks had antidonor antibodies. There were no differences in the intragraft events analyzed by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
DST under the cover of relatively high levels of anti-CD154 failed to result in prolonged graft survival or prevent the formation of antidonor antibodies, when cyclosporine was given after transplantation."

Immunomodulation by interleukin-10 therapy decreases the incidence of relapse and prolongs the relapse-free interval in Psoriasis.	The ability of interleukin-10 therapy to reduce the severity of exacerbated psoriasis has been demonstrated recently. Considering the immunobiologic properties of this cytokine we investigated the effects of long-term interleukin-10 application on the immune system and duration of psoriasis remission. We performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II trial using interleukin-10 in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis in remission. Patients received subcutaneous injections with either interleukin-10 (10 microg per kg body weight; n = 7) or placebo (n = 10) three times per week until relapse or study termination after 4 months. The treatment was well tolerated. In the placebo group almost all patients (90%) showed a relapse during the observation period. In contrast to this, only two of seven patients (28.6%) relapsed in the interleukin-10-treated group. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly lower relapse incidence in the interleukin-10 than in the placebo group (p = 0.02). The mean relapse-free interval time was 101.6 +/- 12.6 d in the interleukin-10 group in comparison with 66.4 +/- 10.4 d in the placebo group. Immunologic activity of interleukin-10 application was indicated by an increase in soluble interleukin-2 receptor plasma levels and higher ex vivo interleukin-4 secretion capacities. Remarkably, a significant negative correlation was demonstrated between the interleukin-4 secretion capacity and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (r = -0.36, p < 0.01). Our data suggest that interleukin-10 therapy is immunologic effective, decreases the incidence of relapse and prolongs the disease-free interval in psoriasis. Its value should be further determined in larger trials and for the prevention of re-exacerbation of other inflammatory disorders with a similar immunologic profile.

Ex vivo exposure to carbon monoxide prevents hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury through p38 MAP kinase pathway.	A direct role of carbon monoxide (CO), an effector-signaling molecule during heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalysis of heme, in the protection against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury needs to be established. This study was designed to determine the effects and downstream mechanisms of CO on cold I/R injury in a clinically relevant isolated perfusion rat liver model. After 24 hours of cold storage, rat livers perfused ex vivo for 2 hours with blood supplemented with CO (300 parts per million) showed significantly decreased portal venous resistance and increased bile production, as compared with control livers perfused with blood devoid of CO. These beneficial effects correlated with improved liver function (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels) and diminished histological features of hepatocyte injury (Banff's scores). The CO-mediated cytoprotective effects were nitric oxide synthase- and cyclic guanine monophosphate-independent, but p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent. Moreover, adjunctive use of zinc protoporphyrin, a competitive HO-1 inhibitor, has shown that exogenous CO could fully substitute for endogenous HO-1 in preventing hepatic I/R insult. This study performed in a clinically relevant ex vivo cold ischemia model is the first to provide the evidence that HO-1-mediated cytoprotection against hepatic I/R injury depends on the generation of, and can be substituted by, exogenous CO. The p38 MAPK signaling pathway represents the key downstream mechanism by which CO prevents the I/R insult. In conclusion, regimens that employ exogenous CO should be revisited, as they may have potential applications in preventing/mitigating I/R injury, and thus expanding the liver donor pool for clinical transplantation.

Improvements in gene therapy: averting the immune response to adenoviral vectors.	Gene therapy is an interesting approach for the correction of defective genes, the treatment of cancer and the introduction of immunomodulatory genes. Various techniques for gene transfer into cells or tissues have been developed within the last decade; these can be divided generally into viral and nonviral gene transfer systems. Nonviral techniques include the liposome- or gene gun-mediated introduction of therapeutic genes; however, the efficiency of gene transfer by these applications is still very low. In contrast, viruses have optimised their strategies for efficient infection of virtually any cell type in a mammalian organism. The genetic modification of genomes from different virus families (Adenoviridae, Retroviridae, Herpesviridae) led to the development of gene therapy vectors with a similar capacity to infect cells or tissues as that of wild type viruses. In contrast to wild type viruses, gene therapy vectors are engineered to transfer therapeutic genes into the target cells or tissues. In addition, they have lost their capacity for replication in target cells, because of the removal of essential genes, which allows replication only in specialised packaging cell lines engineered for the production of recombinant viruses. Despite considerable progress over the past decade in the generation of gene transfer systems with reduced immunogenic properties, the remaining immunogenicity of many gene therapy vectors is still the major hurdle, preventing their frequent application in clinical trials. Recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to be promising vectors for gene therapy, since they are able to transduce both quiescent and proliferating cells very efficiently. However, a major disadvantage of adenoviral vectors lies in the activation of both the innate and adaptive parts of the recipient's immune system when applied in vivo. The inflammatory responses induced by adenovirus particles can be very strong and can be fatal in patients treated with these adenoviral constructs. Therefore, many experiments have been performed in the effort to prevent these inflammatory responses mediated by adenoviral particles. The depletion of cell populations responsible for these inflammatory responses as well as the application of immunosuppressive drugs have been investigated. Moreover, the generation of less immunogenic adenoviral vectors by further genetic modification within the adenoviral genome has led to vectors with reduced immunogenic properties. Both strategies to reduce inflammatory responses against adenoviral particles are discussed in this review.

Bag-1 up-regulation in anti-CD4 mAb treated allo-activated T cells confers resistance to apoptosis.	The non-depleting anti-CD4 mAb RIB5/2 is a powerful inducer of tolerance to MHC-incompatible renal and heart allografts in rat recipients. In vitro the mAb blocks the proliferation and cytokine production of alloreactive T cells. To learn more about the mechanism of anti-CD4-mediated suppression, we applied differential display reverse transcription-PCR to identify differences at mRNA level between T cells stimulated by alloantigen in the presence or absence of anti-CD4 mAb. A sequence alignment of a 550-bp DNA fragment appearing only in anti-CD4 mAb-treated cells resulted in at least 95% homology to a mouse cDNA encoding for the anti-apoptotic protein Bag-1. Further investigation of Bag-1 expression during mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed a three- to fourfold up-regulation of Bag-1 mRNA expression in anti-CD4 mAb-treated allogeneic cultures which was confirmed at protein level. Bag-1 up-regulation was associated with an increase resistance to apoptosis of T cells from anti-CD4 mAb-treated cultures. Application of antisense oligonucleotides specific for Bag-1 reduced Bag-1 protein expression and restored susceptibility to apoptosis. In addition, up-regulation of Bag-1 mRNA could also be detected in graft-infiltrating T cells from anti-CD4 mAb-treated rats in vivo. Thus, the expression of Bag-1 in a subset of anti-CD4 mAb-treated alloreactive T cells conferred resistance against apoptosis, potentially contributing to the long-term survival of these cells.

Early IL-6 plasma concentrations correlate with severity of brain injury and pneumonia in brain-injured patients.	"Brain injury as well as early inflammatory and endocrine responses were found to be indicators for infectious complications in patients with multiple injuries. In this context, brain-derived inflammatory response as well as centrally triggered neuroendocrine activation and systemic immunodepression seem to be of major importance. Therefore, we hypothesize that a circulating index of inflammatory or endocrine function measured soon after brain injury (in patients with admission Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score of 4-7) would discriminate severe from moderate injury as indexed by GCS status on postinjury day 7.
In a retrospective study, 25 patients with either acute traumatic brain injury or cerebral hemorrhage and an initial GCS score of 4 to 7 were examined. Blood samples were obtained at different time points, and different immune variables and neuroendocrine hormones were determined. According to the GCS score on day 7, patients were divided into two groups (GCS score > or = 8, moderate brain injury; and GCS score < 8, severe brain injury or patients who died within the first week) for comparison of variables. Concluding from the results of this retrospective analysis, in a prospective study patients (n = 26) were divided into two groups according to their interleukin (IL)-6 plasma concentrations on day 1 (IL-6 > or = 100 pg/mL and IL 6 < 100 pg/mL). After 7 days, the GCS score, the infection rate, and the mortality were compared between these two groups.
In the retrospective study, we could show that severe brain injury (as assessed by GCS score and mortality on day 7) was associated with high plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase proteins, and neuroendocrine hormones within 2 to 6 hours after the acute event. Among the investigated variables, elevated IL-6 plasma concentrations were stable up to 1 day after the acute event with a high predictive value with regard to the short-term prognosis and incidence of infectious complications within the first week. Because of this stability during the first 24 hours, we selected IL-6 for further studies. In the prospective study with a calculated cut-off IL-6 plasma concentration of 100 pg/mL on day 1, the predictive value of this parameter regarding the severity of the brain injury was fully confirmed (positive predictive value, 0.94; this value represents the observed pretest probability of 0.62). All patients who died (n = 5) or developed infectious complications within the first week (n = 8) showed plasma IL-6 levels > or = 100 pg/mL on day 1.
The IL-6 plasma level 1 day after the acute event with a cut-off of 100 pg/mL (Immulite) seems to be a predictor for short-term prognosis and infectious complications in brain-injured patients."

Antigen-dependent transgene expression in kidney transplantation: a novel approach using gene-engineered T lymphocytes.	So far, gene therapy in transplantation mainly focuses on the expression of therapeutic proteins in the graft itself. Insufficient transfection and inflammatory responses that are due to the immunogenicity of multiple vector systems are often limiting factors in these approaches. The potential of genetically modified T lymphocytes was investigated as a delivery system for therapeutic transgenes to transplanted organs as a way to circumvent immunogenicity and efficiency problems in a rat transplant model. Gene-engineering of alloantigen-specific rat T cell lines was performed by using a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) encoding retroviral transduction system. The ex vivo gene-modified lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into syngeneic rats carrying allogeneic, syngeneic, or third party kidneys. Homing behavior, activation level, and transgene expression of the adoptively given cells were monitored. The T(EGFP) lymphocytes infiltrated the transplanted kidneys in an antigen-specific manner. High numbers of alloantigen-specific T lymphocytes accumulated exclusively in allografts but not in syngeneic or third party grafts. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that only T(EGFP) lymphocytes found in allografts had an activated phenotype that resulted in higher transgene expression. Alloantigen-specific homing, activation, and transgene expression are important prerequisites for the guarantee of localized delivery and expression of transgenic proteins by gene-engineered T lymphocytes. Antigen-specific gene-targeting strategies using ex vivo modified T lymphocytes with donor specificity are a novel approach to the delivery of therapeutic transgenes in transplantation.

Novel immunotherapies for psoriasis.	New insights into the pathophysiology of psoriasis have suggested possibilities for targeted therapeutic intervention. Several novel, systemic immunomodulatory therapies are currently in clinical development and results of recent clinical trials are remarkable. These include approaches targeting antigen presentation and costimulation, T-cell activation and leukocyte adhesion, the action of proinflammatory mediators and the administration of anti-inflammatory cytokines. These trials contribute to our further understanding of the disease, indicating which mechanisms play a greater or lesser part in its development. Moreover, they will lead to new therapeutic options. If psoriasis is considered as a visible model disease for T-cell-mediated disorders characterized by a type-1 cytokine pattern these recent findings might have a more general impact on the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

MK2 targets AU-rich elements and regulates biosynthesis of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 independently at different post-transcriptional levels.	We demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biosynthesis becomes independent of MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) when the AU-rich element (ARE) of the TNF gene is deleted. In spleen cells and macrophages where TNF biosynthesis is restored as a result of this deletion, interleukin (IL)-6 biosynthesis is still dependent on MK2. In MK2-deficient macrophages the half-life of IL-6 mRNA is reduced more than 10-fold, whereas the half-life of TNF mRNA is only weakly decreased. It is shown that the stability of a reporter mRNA carrying the AU-rich 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of IL-6 is increased by MK2. The data provide in vivo evidence that the AU-rich 3'-UTRs of TNF and IL-6 are downstream to MK2 signaling and make MK2 an essential component of mechanisms that regulate biosynthesis of IL-6 at the levels of mRNA stability, and of TNF mainly through TNF-ARE-dependent translational control.

Improvements in early behavior of rat kidney allografts after treatment of the brain-dead donor.	"To improve the quality of organs from brain-dead donors by assessing the influence of alternative strategies on the early behavior of kidneys after transplantation into unmodified hosts.
Kidneys transplanted from living donors perform consistently better than those from cadaver sources. The authors have recently shown that donor brain death produces inflammatory changes in peripheral organs within hours, amplifies coincident ischemia-reperfusion injury, and accelerates acute and chronic rejection. Normalization of the graft by donor hormone treatment has hitherto been unsuccessful.
A standardized rat model of brain death was used. Experimental groups included recipients of allogeneic grafts from living and brain-dead donors (F344-->LEW). Donors were treated immediately after induction of brain death either with intravenous steroids, which block inflammatory cytokine release, or a soluble P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (sPSGL), which blocks initial selectin-mediated cellular adhesion. Kidney grafts were examined serially up to 10 days by morphology, immmunohistology, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Overall survival of ummodified recipients of kidneys from brain-dead donors was significantly reduced versus living donors. Animals with organs from brain-dead donors that had received steroids or sPSGL survived significantly longer than those from untreated brain-dead donors. The intensity of ischemia-reperfusion injury and of acute rejection was reduced. Cellular infiltration and transcription of mRNA of representative proinflammatory mediators were diminished.
Treatment of organ donors at the time of brain death markedly improves organ quality after kidney transplantation, upgrading it to that from a living donor."

Influence of aminosteroid and glucocorticoid treatment on inflammation and immune function during cardiopulmonary bypass.	"During cardiopulmonary bypass, inflammation and immunosuppression is present. We measured circulating mediators and monocyte-based functions and tested the hypothesis that these variables are influenced by methylprednisolone (MP) or tirilazad mesylate (TM) treatment.
Randomized, controlled, double-blind prospective trial.
A university hospital.
Thirty-nine patients scheduled for conventional coronary surgery with three-vessel disease.
Preoperative application of MP (15 mg/kg) or TM (10 mg/kg) compared with placebo (PL).
Circulating proinflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and C-reactive protein were all decreased by MP treatment but not by TM treatment. Whereas rapid increases in circulating anti-inflammatory IL-10 were superinduced by MP but not TM, plasma levels of IL-1RA and transforming growth factor beta were not altered by either treatment. Decreased ex vivo lipopolysaccharide-stimulated secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha was prolonged after MP treatment but not after TM treatment. Perioperative stimulated secretion of IL-12 and interferon gamma was diminished in all groups, whereas ex vivo IL-1RA secretion tended to increase in all groups. Depression of monocyte surface expression of HLA-DR was significantly greater in patients treated with MP, whereas CD14 expression did not change.
These data confirm that, during cardiopulmonary bypass, pro- and anti-inflammatory systems are activated at the same time, whereas monocyte-based immune functions are depressed. Treatment with MP abrogates proinflammatory mediators and induces a shift toward anti-inflammation at the cost of further functional monocyte deficits, whereas treatment with TM apparently has neither anti-inflammatory nor immunosuppressive actions in this setting."

"T cell subsets and in vitro immune regulation in ""infectious"" transplantation tolerance."	CD4-targeted mAb therapy results in permanent acceptance of cardiac allografts in rat recipients, in conjunction with features of the infectious tolerance pathway. Although CD4(+) T cells play a central role, the actual cellular and molecular tolerogenic mechanisms remain elusive. This study was designed to analyze in vitro alloimmune responses of T lymphocytes from CD4 mAb-treated engrafted hosts. Spleen, but not lymph node, cells lost proliferative response against donor alloantigen in MLR and suppressed test allograft rejection in adoptive transfer studies, suggesting compartmentalization of tolerogenic T cells in transplant recipients. A high dose of exogenous IL-2 restored the allogeneic response of tolerogenic T cells, indicating anergy as a putative mechanism. Vigorous proliferation of the tolerogenic T cells in in vivo MLR supports the existence of alloreactive lymphocytes in tolerogenic T cell repertoire and implies an active operational suppression mechanism. The tolerogenic splenocytes suppressed proliferation of naive splenocytes in vitro, consistent with their in vivo property of dominant immune regulation. Finally, CD45RC(+) but not CD45RC(-) T cells from tolerant hosts were hyporesponsive to alloantigen and suppressed the proliferation of normal T cells in the coculture assay. Thus, nondeletional, anergy-like regulatory mechanisms may operate via CD4(+)CD45RC(+) T cells in the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients.

Leukocyte/endothelium activation and interactions during femoral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.	Recent data suggest that leukocyte-endothelium activation/interactions are important for restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Ten patients with superficial femoral artery occlusive disease (stage Fontaine IIb) were examined after a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) versus a preceding aortoangiography (AAG). Blood samples from corresponding femoral arteries and veins were obtained before, immediately after, and 4 hours after each procedure. The authors examined the ex vivo respiratory burst and leukocytic expression of adhesion molecules flowcytometrically, adhesion molecule plasma concentrations, and inflammatory mediators concentrations in plasma and in endotoxin-stimulated whole blood cultures by ELISA, and the leukocyte counts. After PTA, venous plasma concentrations of soluble (s)L-selectin (148.2 +/-14.7%, p<0.05 vs 100% baseline +/- sem), sP-selectin (130.7 +/-6.9%, p<0.01; sE-selectin (117.5 +/-8.3%, p<0.05 vs arterial), sLFA-3 (130.7 +/-15.8%, p<0.05) were increased. Expressions of L-selectin (93.0 +/-5.7%, p<0.05 vs arterial), CD11a (98.8 +/-3.8%, p=0.06), CD18 (96.9 +/-4.0%, p<0.05 vs arterial), and ICAM-1 (89.1 +/-7.7%, p<0.05) on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), and arteriovenous leukocyte counts (arterial: 103.5 +/-5.4%, venous: 91.1 +/-3.3%, p<0.05) decreased. Venous ex vivo secretions of oxygen radicals (141.4 +/-28.1%, p<0.05 vs AAG), PMN-elastase (173.7 +/-35.7%, p<0.05 vs AAG), and interleukin (IL)-8 (226.5 +/-56.4%, p<0.001; p<0.0001 vs AAG), as well as PMN-elastase (173.7 +/-35.7%, p<0.05 vs AAG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plasma concentrations (124.1 +/-11.9%, p=0.06) rose. Four hours after PTA, a leukocytosis and exhausted TNF-alpha (69.8 +/-10.4%, p<0.05) and IL-8 secretions (72.4 +/-4.6%, p<0.01) occurred. PTA induced local leukocyte-endothelium activations (stronger ex vivo mediator productions) and interactions (decreased venous leukocyte counts, increased plasma concentrations, and decreased leukocytic expression of adhesion molecules) with the release of inflammatory mediators (higher plasma concentrations and exhaustions after 4 hours).

Cytotoxic effector molecule gene expression in acute renal allograft rejection: correlation with clinical outcome; histopathology and function of the allograft.	"Cytotoxic effector molecule expression in human renal allograft biopsies has been closely associated with acute rejection. Here we studied whether intragraft expression of perforin, granzyme B, and Fas ligand correlates with long-term clinical outcome of acute rejection episodes. Furthermore, we examined the relation to histopathology and function of the allograft during rejection.
Twenty-two human renal biopsies were quantified for mRNA expression of perforin, granzyme B, Fas ligand, and Fas with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Expression levels were correlated with clinical outcome after 12 months, Banff rejection grades, and allograft function in the course of acute rejection.
Only Fas ligand, but not perforin or granzyme B, showed significantly higher up-regulation in seven samples with therapy-resistant acute rejections versus eight samples with therapy-sensitive acute rejection. We found no relation between cytotoxic marker expression and Banff rejection grades or serum creatinine peak levels.
Fas ligand may be useful as an early marker of therapy-resistant acute rejection. Cells that express Fas ligand but not classical soluble cytotoxic molecules might influence clinical outcome of acute rejection episodes."

Association between Epstein-Barr virus infection and late acute transplant rejection in long-term transplant patients.	Recently we reported about a possible involvement of extrarenal systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in graft deteriorating immune processes. We now examined whether Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may also be associated with late renal graft injury. We analyzed the expression of early antigen-, viral capsid antigen-, and a latency-associated EBV-RNA-transcript, which is not translated into protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of kidney transplant patients with histologically proven late acute rejection and no signs of CMV or any other infection (A), patients with stable graft function (B), and healthy probands (C). A total of 40% in group A vs. 5 and 0% in groups B and C, respectively, expressed early antigen-mRNA (P<0.05) suggesting an activation of lytic EBV infection. Response to steroid bolus therapy in group A was comparably poor with that observed in CMV-related graft injury. Our data suggest that extrarenal lytic EBV infection may also be involved in the pathogenesis of late graft injury. A controlled ganciclovir trial may prove the significance of our observation.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins alpha and beta negatively influence the capacity of tumor necrosis factor alpha to up-regulate the human cytomegalovirus IE1/2 enhancer/promoter by nuclear factor kappaB during monocyte differentiation.	Recently we demonstrated that the ability of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) to stimulate the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity in myeloid progenitor-like cells decreases when these cells differentiate into promonocytic cells. In addition, TNFalpha stimulation in the progenitor-like cell line HL-60 was shown to be mediated by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and its binding to the 18-base pair sequence motifs of the IE1/2 enhancer. We demonstrate here that the cell differentiation-dependent reduction of TNFalpha stimulation is not due to insufficient NF-kappaB activation but correlates with increased synthesis of the monocyte differentiation-associated factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha and beta. Overexpression of C/EBPalpha/beta in HL-60 cells, which normally produce only very small amounts of C/EBP, stimulated the basal activity of the promoter in the absence of NF-kappaB but suppressed the stimulatory effect of TNFalpha. A novel C/EBP-binding site was identified in the IE1/2 enhancer directly downstream of a NF-kappaB site. In order to understand the mechanisms of interaction, we used an IE1/2 promoter mutant that failed to bind C/EBP at this position and several constructs that contained exclusively NF-kappaB- and/or C/EBP-binding sites upstream of the minimal IE1/2 promoter. We could demonstrate that C/EBPalpha/beta interacts with NF-kappaB p65 and displays inhibitory activity even in the absence of direct DNA binding by forming p65-C/EBP-containing protein complexes bound to the NF-kappaB site. Moreover, C/EBP binding to the DNA adjacent to NF-kappaB supports the down-regulatory effect of C/EBPs possibly due to stabilization of a multimeric NF-kappaB-C/EBP complex. Our results show that cell differentiation factors may interfere with TNFalpha-induced human cytomegalovirus gene (re)activation.

Thirty-one patients were included in the study: 8 kidney transplant patients with acute rejection episodes, 5 receiving OKT3 monoclonal antibody therapy, 3 receiving steroid bolus therapy; 21 patients undergoing renal transplantation, 11 receiving ATG perioperatively, 10 without ATG administration; 2 patients undergoing renal transplantation and receiving anti-IL-2R mAb.
Procalcitonin (PCT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha plasma levels were measured in infection-free transplant patients treated with the pan-T-cell antibodies ATG or OKT3. We found PCT plasma concentrations up to 600 ng/ml (reference < 0.5 ng/ ml), which are comparable to those seen in severe sepsis. Increases in TNF-alpha plasma levels preceded the rises in PCT. After peaking on day 1 of therapy the PCT plasma concentrations returned to normal values independently of further antibody administration. In contrast, steroid bolus therapy or anti-interleukin 2 receptor mAb administration did not increase plasma PCT or TNF-alpha levels.

Evidence of T cell clonality in the infectious tolerance pathway: implications toward identification of regulatory T cells.	We have shown that a rare population of regulatory CD4+ T cells plays a key role in the acquisition of infectious tolerance in rat sensitized recipients of cardiac allografts pretreated with nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb. This study was designed to analyze the TCR Vbeta expression patterns in this transplantation model. First, we used Vbeta-specific RT-PCR to show that there was no differential usage of TCR Vbeta genes by T cells mediating rejection or tolerance. Indeed, graft-infiltrating lymphocytes expressed most of the 22 known rat TCR Vbeta genes in both recipient groups, suggesting unrestricted TCR Vbeta repertoire in alloreactive T cells. Then, we applied CDR3 spectrotyping of TCR beta-chain to assess the clonality of T cells at different anatomic sites. CDR3 size restriction, indicative of the presence of T cell clones, was observed in graft-infiltrating lymphocytes but not in draining lymph nodes or spleen of tolerant hosts. Consisent with the clonal expansion, T cells in tolerated grafts exhibited the memory phenotype at a much higher percentage as compared with peripheral lymphoid organs. Moreover, in tolerated graft-infiltrating lymphocytes, the CD3 size restriction occurred in limited Vbeta gene families, with Vbeta8.1 and Vbeta18 most frequently detected. Hence, T cells at the graft site of tolerant recipients contain T cell clones expressing selective Vbeta genes. This phenotypic characteristics of the tolerogenic GILs may potentially be used as a novel marker to identify operational regulatory T cells in organ allograft recipients.

Mechanisms of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (re)activation and its impact on organ transplant patients.	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection plays an important role in transplant patients. Its impact is both direct and indirect. This review focuses on new aspects of HCMV (re)activation and HCMV related pathology, particularly HCMV-associated renal allograft injury. During the last two years we have learned that HCMV is more frequently (re)activated, even in healthy people, than previously expected. Inflammatory as well as stress mediators and some drugs may (re)activate the virus by using distinct intracellular pathways. Commonly, HCMV (re)activation is accompanied by HCMV antigenemia/DNAemia, suggesting that precursor cells in the bone marrow play an important role as a reservoir of latent virus. However, local HCMV (re)activation (colon, lung) without detection of active HCMV infection in the peripheral blood is possible. In healthy people a sufficient type 1 T-cell response controls the active HCMV infection, while in patients with severe immune deficiency (AIDS, high-dose immunosuppression) the virus can spread in an uncontrolled fashion and induce 'classic' HCMV disease. In patients with moderate immune deficiency (e.g. long-term transplant patients on low-dose immunosuppression) virus spreading is controlled but the elimination of cells harboring the active virus may be insufficient. The resulting persistent HCMV antigenemia may induce chronic inflammatory processes leading to tissue injury, particularly in the allograft. Therefore, antiviral therapy may be useful in patients suffering from graft deterioration with otherwise clinically symptomless HCMV infection. HCMV-related immune deficiency with an increased risk of developing bacterial/fungal superinfections is frequently seen in patients with symptomatic HCMV disease but not in asymptomatic CMV antigenemia. The risk of developing superinfections can be predicted by flow-cytometric monitoring of peripheral blood monocytes.

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in the prevention of postoperative infectious complications and sub-optimal recovery from operation in patients with colorectal cancer and increased preoperative risk (ASA 3 and 4). Protocol for a controlled clinical trial developed by consensus of an international study group. Part two: design of the study.	"Presentation of a new type of a study protocol for evaluation of the effectiveness of an immune modifier (rhG-CSF, filgrastim): prevention of postoperative infectious complications and of sub-optimal recovery from operation in patients with colorectal cancer and increased preoperative risk (ASA 3 and 4). This part describes the design of the randomised, placebo controlled, double-blinded, single-centre study performed at an university hospital (n = 40 patients for each group).
The trial design includes the following elements for a prototype protocol: * The study population is restricted to patients with colorectal cancer, including a left sided resection and an increased perioperative risk (ASA 3 and 4). * Patients are allocated by random to the control or treatment group. * The double blinding strategy of the trial is assessed by psychometric indices. * An endpoint construct with quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) and a recovery index (modified Mc Peek index) are used as primary endpoints. Qualitative analysis of clinical relevance of the endpoints is performed by both patients and doctors. * Statistical analysis uses an area under the curve (AUC) model for improvement of quality of life on leaving hospital and two and six months after operation. A confirmatory statistical model with quality of life as the first primary endpoint in the hierarchic test procedure is used. Expectations of patients and surgeons and the negative affect are analysed by social psychological scales.
This study design differs from other trials on preoperative prophylaxis and postoperative recovery, and has been developed to try a new concept and avoid previous failures."

Effects of systemic interleukin-10 therapy on psoriatic skin lesions: histologic, immunohistologic, and molecular biology findings.	Interleukin-10 is an important anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine with major impact on several immune reactions, including regulatory mechanisms in the skin. Recently, we performed a phase II trial in psoriatic patients receiving subcutaneously interleukin-10 over 7 wk. The clinical response suggested that interleukin-10 might represent a novel anti-psoriatic drug. In order to understand better the mode of action and to elucidate the effects of systemic interleukin-10 treatment on the skin immune system, skin punch biopsies from sites different from interleukin-10 injection were analyzed. Biopsies were obtained from the patients before, at the end, and 3 wk after interleukin-10 therapy. The results are reported here. Histologic examination showed a decrease of several parameters reflecting the psoriatic disease activity as acanthosis and extension of the horny layer. Immunohistologic examination demonstrated decreasing numbers of infiltrating T cells, dermal CD1a+ cells, and a diminished proliferation of epidermal cells. Using a novel, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction approach a significant shift within the cytokine pattern was found. Interleukin-10 therapy led to a decrease of cutaneous interleukin-8 and interleukin-10 mRNA expression. Whereas no significant changes of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma expression were found, interleukin-4 was strongly upregulated suggesting a shift from a type 1 towards a type 2 cytokine pattern. The changes within the local cytokine pattern seem to be disease-related, as an inverse course was found in a single interleukin-10 nonresponding patient. Our findings demonstrate considerable effects of systemic interleukin-10 application on the skin immune systems, which might contribute to the anti-psoriatic activity of interleukin-10.

STAT5 pathway: target of anti-CD4 antibody in attenuation of IL-2 receptor signaling.	"Anti-CD4 antibodies induce long-term graft survival by incompletely understood mechanisms, and CD4-ligation with HIV gp120-derivatives attenuates interleukin (IL)-2 receptor signaling. We examined the latter in the context of the CD4-modulating antibody 16H5.
We performed immunoblots to assess the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 and Akt in the presence or absence of 16H5. Furthermore, we documented the effects of 16H5 on the induction of STAT5, activating protein (AP)-1, and myc by IL-2 in DNA-binding assays. 3H-thymidine incorporation of the human lymphoid cell line CMO, which exhibits constitutive activation of the STAT5 pathway and IL2-independent growth, was also measured during 16H5 treatment.
In human T lymphocytes, 16H5 attenuated both the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 by IL-2 and the IL-2-induced DNA-binding of this transcription factor. In contrast, 16H5 had no effect on the serine phosphorylation of Akt by IL-2 or on the IL-2-induced DNA-binding of myc. Signal transduction involving AP-1 was unaffected by 16H5 and IL-2. 16H5 also attenuated CMO cell proliferation.
16H5 targets the STAT5 signaling pathway to attenuate IL-2 receptor signal transduction in human T cells. This observation provides a molecular explanation for the immunomodulatory actions of anti-CD4 antibodies."

[Gene therapy in ophthalmology. Review of options and trends in corneal diseases].	"Gene therapy has gained increasing attention and a number of ongoing clinical trials have been initiated. This article provides current perspectives and limitations on gene therapy in ophthalmology. Since a number of comprehensive studies on gene therapy for retinal diseases already exist, we focus attention to the treatment of anterior segment disorders of the eye.
We undertook a reference search (DIMDI, PubMed) of articles published between (1989-2000) using the key words cornea, conjunctiva, eye, gene therapy, and keratoplasty. The search was restricted to publications in English, French and German. In addition, we incorporated some results of our recent experiments on cytokine gene transfer to the cornea.
Attention to gene therapy in ophthalmology is currently focused on retina and choroidea (40 articles) however, an increasing number of publications includes the cornea (12 articles). The majority of these contributions deals with improvements in the design of gene therapy vectors in particular for targeted application.
Gene therapy to the cornea may offer interesting new venues. Currently, insufficient gene transfer technologies and safety concerns prevent the broad application in humans. However, a broad spectrum of applications can be supposed."

Interaction of a designed interleukin-10 epitope mimic with an antibody studied by isothermal titration microcalorimetry.	The mechanism of recognition of proteins and peptides by antibodies and the factors determining binding affinity and specificity are mediated by essentially the same features. However, additional effects of the usually unfolded and flexible solution structure of peptide ligands have to be considered. In an earlier study we designed and optimized six peptides (pepI to pepVI) mimicking the discontinuous binding site of interleukin-10 for the anti-interleukin-10 monoclonal antibody (mab) CB/RS/1. Three of them were selected for analysis of their solution conformation by circular dichroism measurements. The peptides differ in the content of alpha-helices and in the inducibility of helical secondary structures by trifluoroethanol. These properties, however, do not correlate with the binding affinity. PepVI, a 32-mer cyclic epitope mimic, has the highest affinity to mab CB/RS/1 identified to date. CD difference spectroscopy suggests an increase of the alpha-helix content of pepVI with complex formation. Binding of pepVI to mab CB/RS/1 is characterized by a large negative, favorable binding enthalpy and a smaller unfavorable loss of entropy (DeltaH degrees = -16.4 kcal x mol(-1), TDeltaS degrees = -6.9 kcal x mol(-1)) resulting in DeltaG degrees = -9.5 kcal x mol(-1) at 25 degrees C as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding of pepVI is enthalpically driven over the entire temperature range studied (10-35 degrees C). Complex formation is not accompanied by proton uptake or release. A negative heat capacity change DeltaC(p) of -0.354 kcal x mol(-1) x K(-1) was determined from the temperature dependence of DeltaH degrees. The selection of protein mimics with the observed thermodynamic properties is promoted by the applied identification and iterative optimization procedure.

Improving the in vitro antigen specific T cell proliferation assay: the use of interferon-alpha to elicit antigen specific stimulation and decrease bystander proliferation.	The measurement of the proliferative response of primed T cells to an antigenic stimulus (lymphocyte transformation assay: LTT) is commonly used for determining T cell immune responsiveness. However, the ratio between the spontaneous and the antigen-triggered response (stimulation index) is frequently quite low (<3-5) making the interpretation difficult. We modified the assay by the addition of interferon-alpha and the use of fresh autologous serum instead of human AB pool serum. These measures significantly enhanced the stimulation index following stimulation with tetanus toxoid, Candida albicans and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viral antigen in studies of sensitized patients. There was no concomitant increase in false positive results. Kinetic studies showed a reduced nonspecific background proliferation of non-stimulated cultures particularly between days 4 and 6 of culture. Furthermore, the positive effect of interferon-alpha were confirmed in studies of patients with contact allergy to nickel and gold. We conclude that this modified form of proliferation assay significantly increases the signal to noise ratio which can be attained. This may be of particular value when looking at T cell responses in immunocompromised patients or in diagnostic attempts to detect very low frequencies of antigen-specific T cells.

LTX and RTX patients had a satisfactory seroconversion rate after complete immunisation. However, 2 years later they had experienced a much more rapid antibody decline than controls, and only 59% of LTX and 26% of RTX seroconverters showed titres above the cut-off level defined as protective.

Prolactin enhances the in vitro production of IgG in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus but not from healthy controls.	"Recent evidence suggests that prolactin (PRL) plays a part in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Because B cell hyperreactivity and autoantibodies are characteristic hallmarks of SLE, this study aimed at assessing the impact of this pituitary hormone on IgG production by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with PRL.
PBMC from 11 patients with SLE assessed by the ECLAM score and eight healthy controls were incubated with PRL and cultured for seven days. IgG production was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Spontaneous IgG production of SLE PBMC was significantly enhanced compared with that found in healthy controls. After PRL stimulation, the IgG concentrations of supernatants from SLE PBMC were significantly higher than those of unstimulated PBMC (median 394 ng/ml). Of note, the physiological concentration of PRL (20 ng/ml) induced IgG production more effectively (median 1139 ng/ml) than PRL at 100 ng/ml (median 1029 ng/ml). In contrast, preincubation with PRL did not stimulate IgG production in normal PBMC. A significant correlation between PRL induced IgG production and the disease activity (ECLAM) of the patients with SLE was seen. Moreover, the maximum amount of PRL induced IgG depended on the serum PRL concentrations of the patients with SLE.
The results suggest that PBMC from patients with SLE have an extraordinarily high susceptibility to PRL, showing the most striking effect at a concentration usually found in vivo. This indicates a potential role for mild hyperprolactinaemia in the pathogenesis of SLE, influencing both IgG production and disease activity."

Release of WBC-derived IL-1 receptor antagonist into supernatants of RBCs: influence of storage time and filtration.	"Transfusion-associated immunodepression may be related to the transfer of immunoinhibitory cytokines with blood components.
After evidence of increasing concentrations of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) but not of IL-10 was obtained in supernatants of stored RBC units that were WBC-reduced by centrifugation (C-RBCs) in a pilot study, IL-1RA concentrations were determined weekly in supernatants of C-RBCs and in units that underwent prestorage WBC reduction by in-line filtration (F-RBCs) over a 49-day storage. For assessing total IL-1RA content, complete cell lysis by repeated freezing and thawing was done. The results were related to the changes in WBC count during storage. The dependency of IL-1RA content on preparation procedures was assessed.
The prestorage IL-1RA concentration in C-RBCs (859 +/- 218 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in F-RBC (75 +/- 13 pg/mL). Whereas no changes were seen in F-RBCs during storage, IL-1RA levels in C-RBC supernatants drastically increased to levels about 50 times those in normal plasma (16,327 +/- 2,686 pg/mL on Day 49). Follow-up analysis revealed stringent correlation between IL-1RA release into supernatants and the current loss of WBCs (r = 0.79, n = 42; p<0.001). The total IL-1RA content did not change during storage and was directly dependent on prestorage WBC count. Preparation procedures altered the IL-1RA content only by WBC reduction.
The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-1RA is transmitted by RBCs in relation to WBC content and storage time."

Homing of in vitro-generated donor antigen-reactive CD4+ T lymphocytes to renal allografts is alpha 4 beta 1 but not alpha L beta 2 integrin dependent.	The extravasation and sequestration of Ag-reactive T lymphocytes into vascularized organ allografts depend on a cascade of complex interactions among circulating lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix proteins. Ag-activated donor-specific CD4 T cells are major initiators and effectors in the allograft rejection response. Interfering with the intragraft homing of activated CD4 T cells may represent a novel therapeutic approach in transplant recipients. We have developed a FACS-based short-term homing assay that allows tracing in vitro-generated Ag-reactive CD4 T cells after adoptive transfer in test rat recipients. Allospecific cell lines were preincubated with anti-alpha(4)beta(1) or anti-alpha(L)beta(2) mAb, because of enhanced expression of both integrin receptors after alloactivation. The pretreated Lewis(BN) lymphocytes were carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester labeled and adoptively transferred into Lewis rat recipients of Brown Norway kidney allografts. The injection of equal numbers of PKH-26-labeled untreated cells allowed quantitative comparison of both populations in the same animal. Ex vivo treatment with anti-alpha(4)beta(1) mAb diminished intragraft infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells by 85% in a donor-specific fashion. In contrast, treatment with anti-alpha(L)beta(2) mAb did not affect intragraft cell sequestration. Hence, blocking alpha(4)beta(1) integrin interactions represents a novel strategy in preventing local intragraft recruitment of Ag-reactive CD4 T cells in transplant recipients.

Mechanisms of tolerance induction in second renal allografts of a chronic rejection model.	In a previous experiment we demonstrated the induction of tolerance by the allograft itself. In this model of weak histoincompatibility, second grafts of donor origin replacing chronically rejected first renal allografts were accepted long term. Additionally grafted donor-specific hearts functioned indefinitely while adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated the development of donor-specific transferable tolerance. In the current experiment we compared intragraft gene expression of chronically rejected first and tolerant second grafts by RT-PCR. Second renal allografts of donor origin (F-344) replaced first grafts 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the initial engraftment. No immunosuppression was used during second engraftment. Grafts were followed by serial proteinuria; morphological and immunohistological studies (APAAP/infiltrating cells, ICAM-1, MHC II expression) and competitive RT-PCR analyses (expressed as arbitary units AU/cDNA) for relevant cells and cytokines (CD-3, IFNgamma, IL-10, and IL-4) were assessed by the end of the observation period (16 weeks). Macrophages/monocytes (ED-1+) and T-cells (CD-5 and CD-4+) infiltrated first allografts in high numbers by 12 weeks associated with strong structural signs of chronic graft rejection (ca. 30% arterio- and glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis). Cellular infiltrates in second grafts were prominent, however significantly reduced, while histological changes were minor. At cDNA levels, CD-3 transcripts were elevated in second renal allografts performed 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the initial engraftment while comparable levels were observed when second engraftment was performed after 12 and 16 weeks. Analyses of relevant cytokines demonstrated a TH1/TH2 shift independent from the time interval between first and second engraftment. These results emphasize the role of alloresponsiveness for the development of chronic graft dysfunction. Mechanisms of tolerance induction in our model are associated with a distinct alloresponsive pattern. A crucial role for regulatory T-cells is suggested.

Catecholamines induce IL-10 release in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction by transactivating its promoter in monocytic but not in T-cells.	The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is up-regulated in response to TNF-alpha suggesting a control mechanism of inflammation. In addition, we recently found systemic IL-10 release in response to acute stress reactions in the absence of any systemic inflammation. In vitro and in vivo studies in experimental models suggest that catecholamines induce IL-10 release via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) dependent pathway. Here we studied patients for plasma IL-10 after acute myocardial infarction, a very stressful event without significant signs of systemic inflammation. In fact, the activation of the sympathetic system initiated by cardiac infarction was accompanied by a temporary systemic release of IL-10. Catecholamine induced IL-10 may be released by different cells. Recently, we demonstrated that catecholamines directly stimulate the IL-10 promoter/enhancer via a cAMP/PKA pathway in monocytic cells. A cAMP responsive element (CRE) was identified as major target. Here we show that there is no influence of catecholamines on the IL-10 promoter activity in T-cells. In contrast to monocytic cells, in T-cells cAMP-induced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the CRE-binding protein 1 (CREB-1) seems to play a marginal role in IL-10 induction, which was reflected by a low cAMP-dependent IL-10-promoter/enhancer stimulation in reporter gene assays. Thus, catecholamines are directly involved in the regulation of IL-10 expression in monocytic but not in T-cells after acute stressful conditions.

The treatment of psoriasis with IL-10: rationale and review of the first clinical trials.	By virtue of its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, IL-10 plays a crucial role in several immune reactions, including regulatory mechanisms in the skin. In psoriasis, a common cutaneous immune disease, a relative deficiency in cutaneous IL-10 expression is observed. Several lines of evidence suggest that IL-10 could have antipsoriatic abilities. One pilot and two Phase II trials with sc. IL-10 administration over 3 - 7 weeks in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have supported this hypothesis. The therapy was well-tolerated and clinical efficiency was found in the majority of patients. Immunosuppressive effects (depressed monocytic HLA-DR expression, TNF-alpha and IL-12 secretion capacity, IL-12 plasma levels and responsiveness to recall antigens) as well as a shift towards a Type 2 cytokine pattern (increasing proportion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 producing T-cells, selective increase in IgE serum levels) were observed. These investigations suggest that IL-10 is of major importance in psoriasis and show that IL-10 administration represents a new therapeutic approach. However, long-term administration of large recombinant protein limits the value of this novel therapeutic approach. As such, neither oral nor topical applications are possible; there is a risk of the development of neutralising antibodies.

IL-15 and IL-16 overexpression in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas: stage-dependent increase in mycosis fungoides progression.	Cytokines are of major importance for the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). Recent data suggested that IL-15 and IL-16 are survival/growth factors for the malignant T cells in these entities. To investigate the expression of IL-15 and IL-16 in mycosis fungoides (MF) and CD30+ pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma in vivo, we established a competitive RT-PCR technique. Analyzing skin biopsies from CTCL patients at different stages in comparison to psoriatic and healthy skin, we found IL-15 and IL-16 mRNA overexpression in both CTCL entities. Remarkably, there was some evidence for a stage-dependent increase during MF progression. We found only slight overexpression in early stage MF, when only few tumor cells are detectable within the infiltrates, whereas marked overexpression was found in more advanced lesions, which are characterized by a higher density of malignant cells. These results suggested that CTCL cells themselves might produce the cytokines. To further elucidate this hypothesis, two CTCL cell lines were analyzed but gave conflicting results. Therefore, the cellular origin of the IL-15 and IL-16 overexpression in CTCL remains unclear. Considering the significant overexpression of IL-15 and IL-16 and their biological capacities it is likely that these cytokines contribute to the tumor development. So, they might be involved in growth and skin homing of CTCL cells.

Survival of corneal allografts following adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of interleukin-4.	"Genetic manipulation of the donor cornea ex vivo prior to transplantation may allow modulation of the allogeneic immune response following penetrating keratopasty. In this study we investigated the effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) to rat corneas in an experimental keratoplasty model.
Ex vivo manipulation of Wistar-Furth rat corneas was performed using E1/E3-deleted adenoviral vectors transferring the gene for rat IL-4 (AdrIL-4) under control of the CMV promoter. Following transfection with AdrIL-4 (2 x 10(8) pfu) in DMEM/2% FCS for 3 h, donor corneas were transplanted in MHC class I/II-incompatible Lewis rats. Fifty-two Lewis rats were randomly assigned to receive either nontransfected grafts (n=32), AdrIL-4-transfected grafts (n=8), or syngeneic grafts (n=12).
The rejection rate of AdrIL-4-transfected grafts (85.7%) could not be reduced as compared to controls (62.9%). In addition, the mean survival time of AdrIL-4-transfected grafts (12.6+/-4.5 days) did not differ (P>0.05) from that for untreated transplants (14.1+/-3.8 days).
Our results indicate that overexpression of IL-4 is not sufficient to reduce the rejection rate of corneal allografts in an experimental keratoplasty model. Further investigations are necessary to identify the reasons for failure and establish more efficient modulatory approaches."

Stimulatory and inhibitory action of cytokines on the regulation of hCMV-IE promoter activity in human endothelial cells.	Viral promoters are commonly used as regulatory elements in gene therapy vectors due to their strong activity in various cell lines in vitro. However, transgene expression under the control of viral promoters in vivo has been shown to be limited to a short period of time. Several mechanisms for the transient expression of the delivered transgene may be important including deletion of transduced cells or promoter downregulation. Recently we reported that cytokines may either decrease or increase the activity of the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter in monocytes depending on the differentiation status of the transduced cells. For many applications, the gene of interest has to be delivered into an inflammatory milieu (tumour, ischaemia/reperfusion, vector-induced inflammation etc.). In this report we investigated the influence of various inflammatory cytokines on the hCMV-IE promoter activity in transduced human primary endothelial cells (Huvec) in vitro, which may be the first target cells after gene transfer into different organs. Cultured cells were infected with an E1-deleted adenoviral vector encoding for E. colibeta-galactosidase (Adbeta-gal) driven by the hCMV-IE promoter and incubated either with or without various cytokines. Our results indicate that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) downregulate promoter activity in endothelial cells whereas, in contrast, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) increased the promoter activity. These results suggest that inflammatory processes influence the in vivo expression of transferred viral promoter controlled genes of interest.

Immune response after adenoviral gene transfer in syngeneic heart transplants: effects of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody therapy.	"E1-deleted adenoviral vectors are frequently used for in vivo gene therapy. However, gene expression after adenovirus-(ad) mediated gene transfer is known to be transient due to the generation of an immune response against virus-infected cells. In this study, we asked whether an anti-CD4 mAb (RIB 5/2) treatment may improve the gene transfer into rat cardiac grafts.
We injected recombinant ad-constructs encoding for Escherichia coli beta-gal into syngeneic rat heart transplants via the proximal aorta. One-half of the recipients of genetically modified grafts received the anti-CD4 mAb RIB 5/2, whereas the other half received no monoclonal antibody treatment. Genetically unmodified isografts without any treatment of the recipients were used as additional controls. At different time points hearts were harvested and analyzed for reporter gene expression, intragraft cellular infiltration, and cytokine gene expression (quantitative ""real time"" reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). Serum samples were analyzed for anti-ad-Ig using enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay.
In control animals the beta-gal reporter gene expression slowly increased until day 7 and then declined. The immunohistological and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction intragraft analyses revealed a strong inflammatory response (cellular infiltration, cytokine expression) in ad-transfected grafts that may explain the delayed expression and fast down-regulation of the transgene. Treatment with RIB 5/2 mAb resulted in a faster and prolonged reporter gene expression, reduced graft infiltration, reduced anti-ad-Ig titers and less interferon-gamma up-regulation.
Our results indicate that modulation of the anti-ad immune response using a nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb may increase the efficiency of ad-vectors for gene therapy in the transplant setting."

Ischemia/reperfusion injury-mediated down-regulation of adenovirus-mediated gene expression in a rat heart transplantation model is inhibited by co-application of a TNFRp55-Ig chimeric construct.	E1-deleted adenoviral vectors are efficient vectors for somatic gene therapy. Recently, we have shown that intratracheal application of an adenoviral reporter construct leads to significant reporter gene expression in rat lungs within 24 h. In contrast, reporter gene expression in syngeneic rat heart transplants after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was delayed. Since the adenovirus cannot replicate, down-regulation of the hCMV-IE promoter controlled reporter gene expression in initially infected cells by cytokines, which are released as a result of ischemia/reperfusion injury, might be involved. In order to investigate the role of proinflammatory cytokines, eg TNF-alpha in affecting hCMV-IE promoter-driven reporter gene expression, transient blockade of TNF-alpha was achieved by local co-application of an Ad-construct encoding for a soluble TNFRp55-Ig chimeric molecule in a syngeneic rat heart transplantation model. Co-application of the reporter construct together with the TNFRp55-Ig chimeric molecule significantly increased the early reporter gene expression after transplantation. Moreover, infiltration of inflammatory cells (T cells, macrophages, NK cells) and production of TNF-alpha in the transplant was markedly reduced. Our results indicate that: (1) proinflammatory cytokines are involved in down-regulation of reporter gene expression in ischemia/reperfusion injured tissues; and (2) inhibition of TNF-alpha might be a useful tool to increase early gene expression in gene therapy protocols, particularly in transplantation.

Analysis of CD8 T cell reactivity to cytomegalovirus using protein-spanning pools of overlapping pentadecapeptides.	The frequencies of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein-specific CD8 T cells, identified by the presence of intracellular IFN-gamma, were measured by flow cytometry following stimulation of freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with comprehensive peptide pools. These pools spanned the entire amino acid sequences of the HCMV pp65 and major immediate early (IE-1) proteins and consisted of 15-amino acid peptides with at least nine overlaps between neighboring peptides. As a result all potential CD8 T cell epitopes contained in these proteins were provided by the complete pools and, therefore, unlike with single epitopes, testing was independent of donor HLA type. Individual stimulating peptides from the same pools were identified in parallel experiments. Thus we found that our results with the complete pools using PBMC from 26 healthy HCMV-seropositive donors were 100% sensitive and specific with respect to predicting the presence of recognized epitopes in the respective proteins. In addition, cells from 15 renal transplant patients were tested with complete pools alone. While our results confirmed our previous contention that HCMV IE-1 is an important CD8 T cell target, the technical improvement we made in order to address this question has clearly wider implications. Similar pools may be applied to examine the role of proteins from other pathogens, in autoimmune disease or following vaccination.

Mechanisms of endotoxin tolerance in patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis: role of interleukin 10, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptors as well as effector cell desensitisation.	"In patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, endotoxaemia is a frequent finding. Unknown mechanisms, however, prevent typical clinical symptoms of endotoxaemia in many patients.
We determined plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, ex vivo cytokine secretion capacity, and expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptors on phagocytic blood cells in 49 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 41 age matched healthy controls.
In addition to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in cirrhotic patients, we observed consistent upregulation of the anti-inflammatory mediators interleukin 10 (IL-10) (plasma 15.75 (1. 6) v 6.6 (1.3) pg/ml (p<0.001); ex-vivo 108.4 (22.0) v 40.1 (7.4) pg/ml (p<0.05)), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (plasma 527.1 (83) v 331.4 (56) pg/ml (p<0.05); ex vivo 19.9 (3.4) v 10.2 (2.7) ng/ml (p<0.01)), and soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R) in plasma (sTNF-RI 3157.2 (506.2) v 607.9 (300.3) pg/ml; sTNF-RII 3331.0 (506. 2) v 1066.4 (225.1) pg/ml (p<0.001 for both)). Desensitisation at the target cell level was indicated by reduced expression of TNF receptor I on granulocytes (64.8 (6.5) v 40.1 (7.3)% positive cells; p<0.05) and unaltered plasma levels of soluble E-selectin.
In patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis, upregulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine system and simultaneous desensitisation of effector cells could explain the restricted systemic inflammatory response to chronic endotoxaemia. This alteration in immune status may lead to impairment of host defences against infections which are frequent complications of alcoholic cirrhosis."

Impaired antigen presentation by human monocytes during endotoxin tolerance.	Endotoxin tolerance (ET) has been described as a temporary alteration in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response of monocytic cells after an initial LPS exposure with respect to the production of soluble immunomodulators. Apart from the LPS response, monocytic cells play an important role in initiation of the specific immune response as antigen-presenting cells. This study investigated the capacity of human blood monocytes to induce T-cell stimulation in ET. First, the expression of monocyte surface molecules, important for T-cell interaction, was analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro priming of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS clearly down-regulates major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and the costimulatory molecule CD86. Both changes were dependent on the endogenous interleukin (IL)-10 and less so on the transforming growth factor-beta. In contrast, other accessory molecules on monocytes were only marginally down-regulated (CD58), were not significantly changed during ET (CD40), or even remained up-regulated after initial LPS priming (CD54, CD80). Second, an impact of these phenotypic alterations on the accessory function of monocytes was observed. This was manifested as diminished T-cell proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma release in response to the presence of different recall antigens. Neutralizing IL-10 during LPS priming prevented the diminished T-cell IFN-gamma production but had little effect on T-cell proliferation. These data confirm that ET is an appropriate model of the monocyte functional state in immunoparalysis, which is frequently observed in patients after septic shock, trauma, or major surgery.

Potential of allospecific gene-engineered T cells in transplantation gene therapy: specific T cell activation determines transgene expression in vitro and in vivo.	T lymphocytes, regardless of their specificity, are considered key targets for genetic modification in the treatment of inherited or acquired human diseases. In this study, we generated Lewis T cell lines specific for Dark Agouti rat alloantigens and tested the potential of allospecific T lymphocytes as carriers of genes encoding therapeutic proteins in transplantation gene therapy. These allospecific T lymphocytes were successfully, stably transduced with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by an Mo-MuLV-based retrovirus vector. A novel gene delivery protocol was utilized, resulting in nearly 100% EGFP-expressing T cells. This approach enabled tracking of allospecific transduced T cells in vivo and illustrates their transgene production by fluorometric determination after ex vivo isolation. Quantitation of EGFP transgene expression was used to determine the influence of T cell receptor-specific activation on transgene regulation. A strict positive correlation between activation state and expression level was detected in vitro and in vivo. The activation-induced increase in transgene expression could be blocked by interference with T cell activation signaling pathways by cyclosporin A, anti-CD4 MAb, or CTLA4-Ig. These data provide strong evidence that direct or indirect effects caused by activation-induced transcription factors are crucial in transgene upregulation. Allospecific activation in spleens, lymph nodes, and transplanted grafts can be considered as antigen-specific targeting strategy. This activation might be useful in expressing therapeutic proteins such as TGF-beta or IL-10 specific to these sites. T lymphocyte priming and activation might be prevented or altered by modification of the local microenvironments, thereby exerting a therapeutic influence on acute and chronic graft rejection processes.

Immunological monitoring of the inflammatory process: Which variables? When to assess?	Monitoring the immune responses in critically ill patients helps us to understand pathophysiological aspects of inflammation, immune deficiency, and infection, and to assess objective measures of therapeutic success. Monitoring should be adapted to the individual therapeutic approach. We recommend the measurement of substances in plasma that indicate systemic inflammatory processes, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and invasive infection or endotoxaemia, such as procalcitonin (PCT). Moreover, it is important to evaluate the functional activity of the immune system, which can fail like other organs in the process of multiple organ failure. The resulting immunodeficiency results in failure to eliminate invading pathogens. Plasma concentration of IL-10 and of monocytic function and phenotype (HLA-DR+, CD14+ monocytes, ex vivo TNF secretion capacity) are the most valuable measurements for this purpose.

A novel link between stress and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection: sympathetic hyperactivity stimulates HCMV activation.	Recently, inflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha were identified as triggering active human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Here, we demonstrate that a highly stressful event in the absence of systemic inflammation, as observed in patients with acute myocardial infarction, leads to the development of an active HCMV infection in latently infected patients. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of virus activation, we could show that catecholamines directly stimulate the HCMV immediate-early (IE) enhancer/promoter in monocytic cells via beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Subsequent activation of the cAMP/PK-A-signaling pathway results in enhanced synthesis and binding of the transcription factor CREB-1/ATF-1 to the cAMP-responsive elements within the IE enhancer. Epinephrine also enhanced HCMV gene expression in infected THP-1 cells by about 50% in three of four experiments. These data suggest that HCMV, like HSV-1 and VZV, can be (re)activated under stress conditions.

Intramyocardial electrogram recordings (IMEG) for diagnosis of cellular and humoral mediated cardiac allograft rejection.	"The purpose of this study was to prove the reliability of intramyocardial electrogram (IMEG) recordings for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of (1) cellular and (2) humoral mediated allograft rejection after heart transplantation.
Fifteen beagle dogs underwent heterotopic neck-heart transplantation. Eight of them were previously sensitized through several skin transplantations. IMEG recordings were performed daily. Donor-specific antibodies (IgG, IgM) were determinated in serum daily. Transmyocardial biopsies were performed every two days.
In the sensitized group (group I) accelerated rejection occurred under triple drug immunosuppression with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and cortisone on the fifth postoperative day (range: 4th-5th). All episodes were detected through IMEG diagnosis. In each case rejection could be treated successfully. In the cellular mediated group (group II), the average sensitivity for rejection diagnosis of a single lead was 24% for the unipolar and 42% for the bipolar leads. When the voltages of different leads were summed up the sensitivity rose to 36% (3 unipolar), 81% (3 bipolar) and 100% (all leads). During rejection therapy the IMEG recovered within 24-48 hours.
The IMEG detects cellular and humoral mediated rejection early and with high reliability. The rejection-related changes of grade 2/3a rejection in IMEG seem to follow a Ofocal patternO similar to the histology. Therefore the recording of several, preferably bipolar, electrode configurations appears to enhance diagnostic reliability."

Contribution of prolonged ischemia and donor age to chronic renal allograft dysfunction.	As a consequence of an advancing discrepancy between supply of suitable grafts and demand from potential recipients, less than optimal organs are increasingly being used. Although clinical studies demonstrate the involvement of various risk factors, including donor age and duration of ischemia on long-term graft outcome, their individual contribution and correlation has not been followed experimentally. After cold ischemic times of 5, 60, and 120 min, kidney allografts of 3-, 12-, and 18-mo-old Fischer 344 donors were transplanted into 3-mo-old Lewis rats. Age-related changes were examined in matched native uninephrectomized controls. Proteinuria and creatinine clearance were determined, and histologic and immunohistologic studies were assessed and quantified at the end of the observation period (20 wk). All grafts functioned satisfactorily with the exception of one graft each from 12- and 18-mo-old donors with prolonged ischemia (120 min). Functional deterioration and structural changes progressed in parallel to increasing donor age and prolonged ischemia. The impact of expanded ischemia was particularly detrimental in grafts from older donor animals. Donor age and duration of ischemia act in a synergistic manner in our model. Brief ischemic times seem of particular relevance when grafts from older donors are being used.

The antipsoriatic activity of IL-10 is rather caused by effects on peripheral blood cells than by a direct effect on human keratinocytes.	IL-10 is a promising candidate for the treatment of cutaneous disorders. Antipsoriatic efficacy of systemic IL-10 treatment has been already demonstrated. This includes histomorphological changes in the epidermis, suggesting effects on keratinocytes. However, less is known about direct effects of IL-10 on this cell population, although effects are likely since IL-10 receptor expression on keratinocytes has been demonstrated recently. Therefore we analysed the effects of IL-10 on keratinocytes in vitro, using concentrations of human recombinant IL-10 corresponding to those detectable in plasma during therapy. Proliferation, cytokine formation (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ra), and expression of surface molecules (MHC class I and II, costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, CD29, CD54, CD95) were measured in stimulated and unstimulated cells. Although stimulation influenced the expression levels of certain surface markers, no or only slight effects of IL-10 were found. In contrast considerable inhibitory effects of IL-10 on surface molecule expression and cytokine secretion by peripheral blood human monocytes were observed. Our results suggest that the antipsoriatic activity of IL-10 is rather caused by modulatory effects on circulating immune cells, which subsequently might infiltrate the skin, than by direct effects on human keratinocytes. Considering the remarkable antipsoriatic activity of IL-10 and the observation that IL-10 seem to act on peripheral blood mononuclear cells but not on keratinocytes provide further evidence that circulating immune cells play a key role in the pathology of psoriasis. Finally, our results argue against the value of IL-10 therapy in dermatoses strictly limited to keratinocyte involvement.

Regulatory cells potentiate the efficacy of IL-4 gene transfer by up-regulating Th2-dependent expression of protective molecules in the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients.	"We have previously shown that the tolerant state in allograft recipients can be maintained and perpetuated by an ""infectious"" T cell-dependent regulatory mechanism. Hence, 1) treatment of LEW rats with RIB-5/2, a CD4 nondepleting mAb, produces indefinite survival of LBNF1 cardiac allografts; 2) donor-specific tolerance can be then transferred by spleen cells into new cohorts of test allograft recipients; and 3) putative regulatory CD4+ Th2-like cells are instrumental in this tolerance model. We now report on studies aimed at exposing mechanisms underlying the infectious tolerance pathway, with emphasis on the interactions between intragraft adenovirus-IL-4 gene transfer and systemic infusion of regulatory cells from tolerant hosts. Unlike individual treatment regimens, adjunctive therapy with adenovirus-IL-4 and suboptimal doses of regulatory spleen cells was strongly synergistic and extended donor-type test cardiac allograft survival to about 2 mo. RT-PCR-based expression of intragraft mRNA coding for IL-2 and IFN-gamma remained depressed, whereas that of IL-4 and IL-10 reciprocally increased selectively in the combined treatment group, data supported by ELISA studies. In parallel, only adjunctive treatment triggered intragraft induction of molecules with anti-oxidant (HO-1) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL/Bag-1) but not with pro-apoptotic (CPP-32) functions, both in the early and late posttransplant phases. Hence, systemic infusion of regulatory cells potentiates the effects of local adenovirus-IL-4 gene transfer in transplant recipients. Th2-driven up-regulation of protective molecule programs at the graft site, such as of anti-oxidant HO-1 and/or anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and Bag-1, may contribute, at least in part, to the maintenance of the infectious tolerance pathway in transplant recipients."

Immunomodulatory therapies in sepsis.	Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality from sepsis in ICU patients remains high. In response to several infectious and non-infectious stimuli, monocytes/ macrophages release a number of mediators, including cytokines, involved in the proinflammatory response that underlies sepsis. The excessive release of these mediators results in the development of whole body inflammation, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. In addition, patients with sepsis also undergo an anti-inflammatory phase (the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome) and at times, a mixed response with both pro-and anti-inflammatory components (the mixed antagonistic response syndrome). The initial systemic hyperinflammation is caused by production of inflammatory cytokines, especially tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), and also interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and interferon gamma, which act synergistically with TNF-alpha in inducing shock in animal models. However, clinical trials aimed at downregulating these mediators using antibodies against endotoxin, TNF-alpha, antagonists of IL-1 or platelet activating factor have proved to be uniformly disappointing. Not only have these agents been found to have no effect, but they may also increase mortality. One of the reasons for such failure may be the lack of precise immunological monitoring during the course of sepsis. We have recently demonstrated that sepsis shows a biphasic immunological pattern during the initial and later phase: the early hyperinflammatory phase is counterbalanced by an anti-inflammatory response which may lead to a hypoinflammatory state. The latter is associated with immunodeficiency that is characterised by monocytic deactivation, so-called immunoparalysis. Interferon gamma-1 b has an immunoregulatory effect in patients with immunoparalysis during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, not only restoring levels of HLA-DR expression but also reestablishing the ability of monocytes to secrete cytokines such as TNF-alpha. By monitoring immune status in septic patients, targeted intervention may lead to more success in immunomodulation of sepsis.

Fundoplication: a model for immunologic aspects of laparoscopic and conventional surgery.	"Immunologic investigations of laparoscopic and conventional procedures have recently been performed during cholecystectomy or colon resection, but the results might have been influenced by the amount of dissection or the presence of malignant tumor. Because fundoplication is characterized by moderate dissection and no resection, we supposed it to be an appropriate procedure for comparing immunologic changes during laparoscopic and conventional surgery.
Immunologic analysis (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, leukocytes, HLA-DR monocytes) was carried out on the peripheral blood of 34 patients who underwent elective Nissen fundoplication by the laparoscopic (LAP; N = 26) or conventional (OPEN; N = 8) technique for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Blood samples were obtained before and 1 and 4 hours after the beginning of the operation and on days 1, 2, 4, 7 after the procedure.
A very fast and significant (P < 0.01) increase of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) and leukocytes and a decrease of cell-mediated functions (HLR-DR monocytes) were detected. Most of the analyzed measures had returned to preoperative values by 2 days after the procedure. All of the changes were similar in the two groups with the exception of IL-6. Throughout the post-operative study period, IL-6 concentrations were higher in the OPEN group, being significant 4 hours, 1 day, 2 days, and 4 days after the operation.
The investigation measures do not give evidence that laparoscopic fundoplication is superior to conventional fundoplication in its immunologic effects."

Measurement of anti-human cytomegalovirus T cell reactivity in transplant recipients and its potential clinical use: a mini-review.	By allowing direct determination of the frequencies of antigen-specific memory T cells in peripheral blood, novel techniques based on flow cytometry provide new diagnostic opportunities in various clinical settings, including organ transplantation. While the importance of the T cell compartment for the anti-human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immune response is undisputed, efficient monitoring of this response was previously impossible because the conventional methods for measuring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are too time-consuming and cost-intensive. We analyzed how the rapid induction of anti-HCMV CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells by HCMV viral lysate or HCMV-derived peptides, respectively, followed by a flow-cytometric detection step, may be used to monitor HCMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells in solid-organ recipients. We also discuss a number of preconditions for integrating such testing into the clinical routine.

Human cytomegalovirus reactivation in bone-marrow-derived granulocyte/monocyte progenitor cells and mature monocytes.	Monocyte/granulocyte progenitor cells of the bone marrow are a major site of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latency. The mechanisms of establishment and maintenance of HCMV latency are still unknown. Reactivation of the latent virus in bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells has been demonstrated in vitro and suggested to occur also in vivo. Clinical studies have shown that reactivation is a rather frequent event not only in immunosuppressed but also in nonimmunosuppressed patients and in healthy blood donors. At least three independent mechanisms of virus reactivation are discussed: systemic inflammation connected with strong tumor necrosis factor alpha release; application of cAMP-elevating drugs, and highly stressful events associated with increased plasma catecholamine levels.

Interleukin-10 in cutaneous disorders: implications for its pathophysiological importance and therapeutic use.	With its antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive properties interleukin-10 (IL-10) plays a dominant role in several immune reactions including regulatory mechanisms in the skin. The overexpression of this mediator has been reported in some inflammatory dermatoses as well as in various skin tumors. These observations are of importance since they may explain the limitation of hyperinflammatory conditions as in eczemas and erythemas on the one hand and the suppression of an adequate antitumor response and thereby the progression of malignant tumors on the other hand. Moreover, elevated IL-10 expression might contribute to an enhanced risk of development of microbacterial superinfections, a frequent finding in several dermatoses, and might also be involved in the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases. In contrast, recent studies indicate a relative IL-10 deficiency in psoriasis. Early clinical data from psoriatic patients treated with recombinant human IL-10 suggest the therapeutic potential of this cytokine and underline its impact on the regulation of the skin immune system.

Plasma cytokine parameters and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure.	"Inflammatory immune activation is an important feature in chronic heart failure (CHF). Little is known about the prognostic importance of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF-receptor 1 and 2 (sTNF-R1/sTNF-R2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and soluble CD14 receptors (sCD14) in CHF patients.
In 152 CHF patients (age 61+/-1 years, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 2.6+/-0.1, peak VO(2) 17.3+/-0.6 mL. kg(-1). min(-1), mean+/-SEM) plasma concentrations of immune variables were prospectively assessed. During a mean follow-up of 34 months (>12 months in all patients), 62 patients (41%) died. Cumulative mortality was 28% at 24 months. In univariate analyses, increased total and trimeric TNF-alpha, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2 (all P</=0.0001), sCD14 (P=0.0007), and IL-6 (P=0.005) predicted 24-month mortality. With multivariate analysis and receiver operating characteristics, sTNF-R1 emerged among all cytokine parameters as the strongest and most accurate prognosticator in this CHF population, regardless of follow-up duration and independently of NYHA class, peak VO(2), VE/VCO(2) slope, left ventricular ejection fraction, and wasting (P<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for sTNF-R1 was greater than for sTNF-R2 at 6, 12, and 18 months (all P<0.05).
sTNF-R1 was the strongest and most accurate prognosticator, independent of established markers of CHF severity. Assessment of sTNF-R1 may be useful in identifying patients who are at high risk of death and in monitoring patients undergoing anti-TNF-alpha treatment."

Mechanisms of brain-mediated systemic anti-inflammatory syndrome causing immunodepression.	"Overwhelming inflammatory immune response can result in systemic inflammation and septic shock. To prevent excessive and deleterious action of proinflammatory cytokines after they have produced their initial beneficial effects, the immune system can release several anti-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-10, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors, thus initiating a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome. However, in vivo the delicate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses is additionally controlled by the central nervous system. Therefore, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and enhance sympathetic nerve system activity. The mediators of these neuroimmune pathways can again suppress immune cell functions to control systemic inflammation. The question is, however, what happens if the immunoinhibitory CNS pathways are activated without systemic inflammation? This can result from production of cytokines in the brain following infection, injury, or ischemia or in response to various stressors (e.g., life events, depression, anxiety) or directly from brainstem irritation. The answer is that this may generate a brain-mediated immunodepression. Many animal and clinical studies have demonstrated a stress and brain cytokine mediated decrease in the cellular immune response at the lymphocyte level. More recently, the importance of monocytes in systemic immunocapacity has been shown. Monocytic inactivation with decreased capability of antigen presentation and depressed secretion of proinflammatory cytokines increases the risk of infectious complications. Interestingly, cytokines in the brain and other stressors can also generate systemic immunodepression at the monocyte level. In this scenario the catecholamine-induced release of the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 is a newly discovered mechanism of the brain-mediated monocyte deactivation in addition to the ""well known"" immunosuppressive action of glucocorticoids. Furthermore, other neuropeptides such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin which can be released in stressful situations have also inhibitory effects on immune cells. Thus mediators of the CNS are implicated in the regulation of immune functions and may play a role in both conditioning the host's response to endogenous or exogenous stimuli and generating a ""brain-mediated"" immunodepression."

Upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 protects genetically fat Zucker rat livers from ischemia/reperfusion injury.	We examined the effects of upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in steatotic rat liver models of ex vivo cold ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In the model of ischemia/isolated perfusion, treatment of genetically obese Zucker rats with the HO-1 inducer cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP) or with adenoviral HO-1 (Ad-HO-1) significantly improved portal venous blood flow, increased bile production, and decreased hepatocyte injury. Unlike in untreated rats or those pretreated with the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), upregulation of HO-1 by Western blots correlated with amelioration of histologic features of I/R injury. Adjunctive infusion of ZnPP abrogated the beneficial effects of Ad-HO-1 gene transfer, documenting the direct involvement of HO-1 in protection against I/R injury. Following cold ischemia/isotransplantation, HO-1 overexpression extended animal survival from 40% in untreated controls to about 80% after CoPP or Ad-HO-1 therapy. This effect correlated with preserved hepatic architecture, improved liver function, and depressed infiltration by T cells and macrophages. Hence, CoPP- or gene therapy-induced HO-1 prevented I/R injury in steatotic rat livers. These findings provide the rationale for refined new treatments that should increase the supply of usable donor livers and ultimately improve the overall success of liver transplantation.

[Prophylactic effectiveness of propolis for immunostimulation: a clinical pilot study].	"The aim of this pilot investigation was to show the evidence of the prophylactic immunostimulating effectiveness caused by propolis. The immune response was determined by the measurement of the cytokine level in vivo and ex vivo (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8).
In an open prospective monocentric study, test persons received Propolis XNP.
10 healthy test persons aged between 18 and 45 years, with normal weight and of either sex.
Probands received over 13 days 500 mg Propolis XNP (2 capsules) for peroral application in the morning.
Significant changes of the investigated cytokine secretion capacity during and after the treatment of propolis compared to the situation without medication.
Although the cytokine plasma levels did not significantly change during the study, propolis led to a significant increase of both the spontaneous (TNF-alpha, p < 0. 05; IL-6, p < 0.01; IL-8, p < 0.02; IL-1beta, not detectable) and LPS(lipopolysaccaride)-induced (TNF-alpha, p < 0.001; IL-6, p < 0. 02; IL-8, p < 0.0005; IL-1beta, p < 0.05) cytokine secretion capacity following short-term ex vivo culture of peripheral blood leukocytes. Whereas the IL-6 secretion capacity further increased during the 13-day application, the IL-8 and TNF-alpha secretion reached a plateau after day 4 and the TNF-alpha secretion even decreased, but the level at day 13 was still significantly higher than at day 0.
As the cytokine secretion capacity but not the cytokine plasma levels increased significantly during therapy, the prophylactic application of propolis led to a time dependent enhanced immune reactivity without undesired side effects."

Intragraft overexpression of interleukin-4 is neither sufficient nor essential for tolerance induction to cardiac allografts in a high-responder strain combination.	"Recently we have demonstrated that the nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) RIB5/2 induces long-term acceptance of kidney and heart allografts in all rat strain combinations tested. Cytokine gene expression studies by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed a reversed intragraft interleukin (IL)-4/interferon-gamma ratio. Whether IL-4 mediated immune deviation contributes to transplantation tolerance is not clear so far.
To learn more about the functional relevance of the relative IL-4 up-regulation, IL-4 was overexpressed in rat heart allografts by using ex vivo adenoviral gene transfer. The efficiency of gene transfer was analyzed by reporter gene assays as well by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of IL-4 mRNA expression.
The intragraft overexpression of IL-4 did not prolong the allograft survival compared with controls. Moreover, neutralization of IL-4 by OX81 mAb did not prevent tolerance induction by RIB5/2 treatment.
Anti-CD4 mAb-induced tolerance is associated with an intragraft type1/type2 shift, however, the up-regulation of IL-4 alone is neither sufficient nor essential to induce tolerance to cardiac allografts in a high-responder strain combination."

Immunogenicity and safety of hepatitis A vaccine in liver and renal transplant recipients.	Organ transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection may be at increased risk of fulminant hepatitis A. Liver transplant (LTX) recipients, renal transplant (RTX) recipients, and healthy controls received 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine 6 months apart. Anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) seroconversion after the primary dose occurred in 41% of the LTX patients, 24% of the RTX patients, and 90% of the controls. After the booster dose, the respective rates were 97%, 72%, and 100% (P<.001). RTX patients also had significantly lower geometric mean titers (GMTs) of anti-HAV than LTX patients and controls. In the RTX group, the seroconversion rate and GMT were inversely associated with the number of immunosuppressive drugs received by the patients. The vaccine was well tolerated. Hepatitis A vaccine can be recommended to LTX and RTX patients, but the patients should receive a full course of 2 doses before imminent exposure.

MAPKAP kinase 2 is essential for LPS-induced TNF-alpha biosynthesis.	MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) is one of several kinases that are regulated through direct phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase. By introducing a targeted mutation into the mouse MK2 gene, we have determined the physiological function of MK2 in vivo. Mice that lack MK2 show increased stress resistance and survive LPS-induced endotoxic shock. This is due to a reduction of approximately 90% in the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and not to a change in signalling from the TNF receptor. The level and stability of TNF-alpha mRNA is not reduced and TNF-alpha secretion is not affected. We conclude that MK2 is an essential component in the inflammatory response which regulates biosynthesis of TNF-alpha at a post-transcriptional level.

Tumor size and lymph-node status in pancreatic carcinoma - is there a correlation to the preoperative immune function?	"It has not been clarified whether there is a correlation between the tumor size and the preoperative immune function in pancreatic carcinoma.
In a prospective trial, the influence of tumor size and lymph-node status on different immune system factors [interleukins (IL)-6 and -10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-lymphocytes, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR-monocytes] was analyzed in 28 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and compared with a control group (n=20). There were 3 pancreatic carcinomas of the T1-tumor type, 20 T2- and 5 T3-tumors; 14 patients were in stage N1.
In comparison with the control group, tumor patients preoperatively showed a significant increase of leukocytes (P=0.02), monocytes (P=0. 04), and granulocytes (P=0.03). The total count of lymphocytes, the number of CD3-, CD4- and CD8-lymphocytes, and the expression of HLA-DR on monocytes were significantly decreased as a sign of immunosuppression in tumor patients. A multivariate analysis proved that only tumor size (T-stage) but not lymph-node status correlates with the deficiency of immune competence. Progressive tumor size correlated with decreasing expression of HLA-DR on monocytes, CD3- (P=0.04) and CD8- (P=0.02) lymphocytes. In contrast IL-6, IL-10 (P=0. 04) and TNF-alpha (P=0.02) increased with progressive tumor size.
Regarding the negative prognosis after resection, the preoperative immune status could be an additional help for decision between a resection or a preoperative immune stimulation in pancreatic carcinoma."

Effect of filgrastim treatment on inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte functions.	Twenty-four healthy male volunteers received either placebo or 75, 150, or 300 microg filgrastim (recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) for 12 days to study effects on monocytes and lymphocytes. In all filgrastim-treated groups, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) release by whole blood in response to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) was reduced. IL-12 added in vitro to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood of filgrastim-treated donors restored IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha release, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is exercised through IL-12 suppression. Phytohemagglutinin- or anti-CD3 antibody-induced lymphocyte proliferation ex vivo was reduced by 60% from day 5 to day 15, after a 50% increase at day 2 with concomitant doubled IL-2 release. In vivo, filgrastim induced doubling of all T-cell populations by day 8. Filgrastim decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation ex vivo throughout prolonged treatment at all doses. This indicates that endogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may counterregulate the inflammatory cytokine cascade and implies a potential indication for filgrastim in chronic inflammatory conditions.

Expression of interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukins-6, -10 and -4, and metalloproteases by freshly isolated mononuclear cells from early never-treated and non-acute treated rheumatoid arthritis patients.	"To determine IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression by freshly isolated peripheral blood (PBMC) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) in early, never-treated (ENT-RA) and non-acute, treated rheumatoid arthritis (NAT-RA) patients. To elucidate whether excessive or inadequate interleukin (IL) and metalloprotease (MMP) expression is influenced by the disease duration.
Fourteen RA patients, 7 with early RA (< 1 year of evolution) never treated with corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and 7 patients with non-acute RA (> 2 years of evolution) treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, were studied by ELISA and quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR. A group of 14 healthy subjects matched for sex and age was included.
No statistically significant difference in the protein or transcript levels for the cytokines of interest was found between the ENT-RA and NAT-RA groups. The cytokine mRNA expression by freshly isolated PBMC and SFMC in both groups was as follows: IL-1 beta > TNF alpha > IL-10 > IL-6, with no mRNA IL-4 expression. In contrast, cytokine serum levels in ENT-RA and NAT-RA patients were detected in inverse order as follows: IL-6 > IL-10, while IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IL-4 were undetectable. MMP-3 mRNA expression by the PBMC of NAT-RA patients was statistically different to that in ENT-RA patients. Similar levels of mRNA expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13 by the PBMC and SFMC in both RA groups were observed.
A close equilibrium between MMP and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokine production is observed in ENT-RA and NAT-RA patients. This balance is apparently not influenced by the length of the disease. Highly sensitive methods such as quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA, and even studying freshly isolated MC, showed sustained cytokine secretion at the local level (synovial fluid/SFMC) and scarce translation at the peripheral level (serum/PBMC). Expression of MMP mRNA needs to be further evaluated in order to know whether their peripheral expression reflects their local activity in RA patients."

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive elements are involved in the transcriptional activation of the human IL-10 gene in monocytic cells.	IL-10 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses. We and others have demonstrated recently that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating substances up-regulate monocytic IL-10 expression in vitro and in vivo. Computer analysis of the IL-10 promoter/enhancer region localized four putative cAMP-responsive elements (CRE1- 4) with homology to the CRE consensus motif. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays CRE1 and CRE4 bound protein complexes consisting of transcription factors CREB-1 and ATF-1, while CRE3 bound only marginal amounts of CREB-1/ATF-1 in combination with unknown protein(s). CRE2 showed no protein binding activity. In vitro mutation of CRE1 and CRE4 reduced the level of cAMP-stimulated transactivation in reporter gene assays in comparison to the wild-type promoter by 20 % and 50 %, respectively, while mutation of CRE3 had no effect. The main action of CRE4 on cAMP-dependent stimulation is probably based on its adjacent localization to the TATA box and its sequence comprising a perfect half site. Experiments with double and triple mutants and with deleted promoter fragments indicated the participation of additional elements beside the CRE motifs in the cAMP-dependent stimulation. Our data suggest that intracellular cAMP may directly affect expression of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 in monocytic cells via activation of the eukaryotic transcription factors CREB-1 and ATF-1 and their binding to CRE1 and CRE4 in the upstream enhancer of the IL-10 promoter.

Distribution of human CMV-specific memory T cells among the CD8pos. subsets defined by CD57, CD27, and CD45 isoforms.	"Chronic antigenic stimulation has been associated with peripheral blood expansions of CD8pos.

However, the relationship and functional significance of these subset(s) has remained controversial. Here, this issue was addressed using a novel flow cytometric technique that allows simultaneous detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific CD8pos. memory T cells by rapid (< 6 h) HCMV peptide-specific induction of cytokine synthesis, and their phenotypic characterization, including CD57, CD27 and CD45RA/RO. The vast majority of resting CD8(pos.) T cells capable of rapid induction of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha synthesis in response to HCMV peptides were found in a subset characterized by intermediate to high expression of CD57, down-regulation/loss of CD27, and varying degrees of reversal of the classical ""memory"" CD45RO(bright) /RA(dim) phenotype. This subpopulation likely includes the fully differentiated memory cells responsible for the long-term immune defense against HCMV reactivation."

Target structures of the CD8(+)-T-cell response to human cytomegalovirus: the 72-kilodalton major immediate-early protein revisited.	Cell-mediated immunity plays an essential role in the control of infection with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). However, only a few CD8(+)-T-cell epitopes are known, with the majority being contained in the pp65 phosphoprotein, which is believed to dominate the CD8(+)-T-cell response to HCMV. Here, we have readdressed the issue of CD8(+) T cells specific for the 72-kDa major immediate-early protein (IE-1), which is nonstructural but is found very early and throughout the replicative cycle. Using a novel flow-cytometric assay, we were able to identify CD8(+)-T-cell epitopes (by IE-1 peptide-specific induction of cytokine synthesis) and simultaneously measure the frequency of cells directed against them. For this purpose, 81 pentadecamer peptides covering the complete 491-amino-acid sequence of IE-1 were tested on peripheral blood mononuclear cells of anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-seropositive donors. At least 10 new epitopes were identified, and the fine specificity and presenting HLA molecule of the first of them was determined. The frequencies of CD8(+) T cells directed against IE-1 were similar to those directed against pp65 in donors tested with known pp65-derived peptides. Importantly, additional testing of a corresponding set of peptides covering the complete sequence of pp65 on 10 of these donors identified individuals whose CD8(+) T cells recognized IE-1 but not pp65 and vice versa, clearly illustrating that either protein may be a major target. In summary, our results suggest that IE-1 is far more important as a CD8(+)-T-cell target than current opinion suggests.

Disappearance of hepatitis B virus core deletion mutants and successful combined kidney/liver transplantation in a patient treated with lamivudine.	Hepatitis B virus (HBV) core deletion variants with enhanced viral replication are associated with rapid deterioration of liver function in renal allograft recipients. Antiviral agents such as famciclovir and lamivudine offer new treatment strategies for these patients. Appearance, accumulation and persistence of HBV core deletion mutants were closely monitored in a kidney transplant recipient with liver cirrhosis before and after initiation of antiviral treatment. Under treatment with famciclovir HBV DNA concentration decreased by 50 %, HBV mutants persisted. After replacement of famciclovir by lamivudine HBV replication was reduced below the detection limit. Lamivudine was well tolerated and liver function improved. After successful combined kidney/liver transplantation the patient became HBsAg and HBV DNA (detected by PCR) negative under continuous hyperimmune globulin and lamivudine treatment. Antiviral therapy with lamivudine may be useful in treatment of progressive liver disease associated with HBV core deletion mutants in renal allograft recipients and may enable successful liver transplantation.

Continuous infusion of proinflammatory cytokines into the brain to study brain cytokine induced local and systemic immune effects.	Proinflammatory cytokines are produced in the brain after various kinds of insult (ischemia, trauma, infection). In this process interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are most important. These cytokines are key mediators of inflammation. Furthermore, these cytokines can act as neurotransmitters and develop direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including fever, sleep and stimulation of the neuroendocrine as well as sympathetic nervous system. Moreover, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha may also be involved in brain repair and regenerating processes. However, most of the data about the role of cytokines in the brain have been obtained from either in vitro studies or bolus injections into the brain parenchyma or cerebroventricular system. On the other hand, it is known that cytokines are released continuously into the brain after a cerebral insult over a period of 24 to 48 h. In order to further complete the knowledge about the interactions between neural and immune cells to overcome the primary insult and initiate repair and regeneration in the CNS, a new animal model of local inflammation reaction was established using chronic intracerebral infusion of rat recombinant cytokines.

Evidence for conformationally different states of interleukin-10: binding of a neutralizing antibody enhances accessibility of a hidden epitope.	We present the mapping of two anti-human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) antibodies (CB/RS/2 and CB/RS/11) which have been described as binding their antigen cooperatively. The epitopes were identified using hIL-10-derived overlapping peptide scans prepared by spot synthesis. To identify residues essential for binding within the two epitopes, each position was replaced by all other L-amino acids. The epitope-derived peptides were further characterized with respect to antibody affinity and their inhibition of the antibody-hIL-10 interaction. One antibody (CB/RS/11) binds to residues which are completely buried in the X-ray structure of IL-10. Accessibility of this hidden epitope is enhanced upon binding of the antibody CB/RS/2, which recognizes a discontinuous epitope located nearby. The recognition of the hidden CB/RS/11 epitope, as well as the cooperative binding behaviour of the two antibodies, provides evidence that IL-10 can adopt a conformational state other than that observed in the crystal structure.

Distinct tolerance pathways in sensitized allograft recipients after selective blockade of activation signal 1 or signal 2.	"CD4-targeted therapy or blocking of CD28-B7 T-cell costimulation may produce indefinite cardiac allograft survival in presensitized rats. This study analyzes the immune events associated with tolerance pathways after the blockade of activation signal 1 (CD4 monoclonal antibody [mAb]) or signal 2 (CTLA4Ig).
Lewis rats sensitized with Brown Norway skin grafts reject LBNF1 cardiac allografts in <36 hr. Animals were treated with RIB-5/2, a nondepleting CD4 mAb, or with CTLA4Ig + LBNF1 spleen cells. RIB-5/2 monotherapy uniformly produced permanent cardiac graft acceptance, whereas CTLA4Ig produced indefinite graft survival in about 50% of sensitized rats. Spleen cells (100 x 10(6)) from CD4 mAb-treated rats conferred donor-specific tolerance after transfer into new sets of recipients. This tolerant state could be then transferred with regulatory cells in an infectious manner into new cohorts of engrafted rats. In contrast, features of infectious tolerance could be detected in CTLA4Ig-treated hosts after infusion of >300 x 10(6) of splenocytes. CD4 mAb therapy abolished the transcription of both T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines compared with rejecting controls. In contrast, CTLA4Ig treatment resulted in a selective sparing of Th2-type cytokines. Surviving grafts in both groups were largely protected from signs of chronic rejection.
CD4 mAb-induced blockage of activation signal 1 or CTLA4Ig-mediated blockage of costimulatory signal 2 may induce a true transplantation tolerance in sensitized rats, as documented by permanent graft acceptance and attenuation of chronic injury. The infectious pathway operates in a cell dose-dependent manner. Th2-type deviation in the graft itself is not required for tolerance maintenance, and it does not necessarily lead to chronic injury."

Cytokine gene activation in synovial membrane, regional lymph nodes, and spleen during the course of rat adjuvant arthritis.	Cytokine gene activation was assessed during rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) in synovial membrane (SM), popliteal lymph node (popl-LN), and spleen, using semiquantitative, competitive RT-PCR. Changes in the popl-LN were considerably higher than in spleen or SM. In the preclinical phase (day 6), cytokine mRNA elevations occurred exclusively in the popl-LN and included IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10. In the acute phase (days 13-16) all three organs became involved: (i) in the SM, significant elevations were limited to IL-1beta and IL-6, which, notably, correlated positively with the degree of arthritis; (ii) in the popl-LN, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 (but not IL-5) were still elevated, while IL-2 rose significantly; (iii) in the spleen, TNF-alpha peaked simultaneously with the arthritis score (day 16) and dramatically dropped thereafter. Upon transition into the chronic phase (day 20) the following phenomena were observed: (i) IL-1beta and IL-6 were still significantly increased in the SM; (ii) IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were still elevated in the popl-LN; and (iii) there was a progressive rise of IL-5 mRNA in the spleen, positively correlated with the arthritis score. In conclusion, cytokines with pro- and anti-inflammatory functions overlap throughout disease, but in different organ-related patterns. Local (SM) and regional (popl-LN) IL-1beta and IL-6, elevated throughout the entire course of AA, may directly contribute to disease severity. While in AA spleen TNF-alpha appears to be a systemic marker of acute disease, spleen IL-5 may be involved in disease resolution.

Compound deletion of the rhoGAP C1 and V2 vasopressin receptor genes in a patient with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.	The function of small GTPases is fine-tuned by a complex network of regulatory proteins such as GTPase-activating proteins. The C1 gene at Xq28 encodes a protein assumed to function as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (rhoGAP). Characterization of the molecular defect causing X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in a patient revealed a submicroscopic deletion of a 21.5-kb genomic fragment encompassing the entire arginine-vasopressin V2 receptor gene (AVPR2) and most of the C1 gene locus. In the absence of detailed information about the physiological relevance and specific functions of rhoGAP C1, a thorough clinical and laboratory investigation of the patient was performed. Besides clearly defined NDI symptoms caused by deletion of the AVPR2 gene, no major morphological abnormalities as determined by physical examination, radiography, ultrasound, and computed tomographic scan were detected. Extensive analysis of blood chemical, enzyme, and hormone values over a period of 16 years showed no deviations from normal ranges. On the basis of our observations, the rhoGAP C1 protein is not essential for normal development in the human. Because of a predominant expression pattern of the C1 gene in hematopoietic cells, we focused on immunologic and hematologic laboratory parameters of the affected boy and the mother who was found to be heterozygous. Differential white cell counts, including lymphocyte typing, determination of lymphokines, cytokines, and immunoglobulins, as well as numerous leukocyte function tests, showed no pathological findings. Therefore, we postulate that the loss of rhoGAP C1 function is most likely compensated by other members of the GAP family.

A high prevalence of cytomegalovirus antigenaemia in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis: an association with systemic tumour necrosis factor alpha overexpression.	Microbiological aspects are considered to be of pathophysiological importance in psoriasis, but there has so far been no information regarding cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This is of interest due to the high prevalence of latent infection in the general population, the frequent reactivation in inflammatory diseases, and the immunomodulating capacity of CMV. To detect active infection we analysed CMV antigen expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from psoriatic patients (n = 30) in comparison with healthy volunteers (n = 65). Using three monoclonal antibodies and immunocytological staining (alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase technique), we frequently found CMV antigenaemia in psoriasis (43%) compared with healthy laboratory staff (12%, P < 0. 01) and blood donors (6%, P < 0.001). Clearance of CMV antigenaemia was observed with antipsoriatic treatment. CMV antigenaemia was symptomless, and was associated with seropositivity for anti-CMV IgG but not IgM antibodies, indicating subclinical activation of latent infection. Serological investigations in 85 psoriatic patients gave no evidence for a higher prevalence of latent CMV infection. In psoriatic lesions, CMV DNA was only rarely detected by polymerase chain reaction. As it has been shown that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha can induce CMV reactivation, we determined TNF-alpha plasma concentrations and mRNA expression in PBMC from psoriatic patients. Elevated TNF-alpha levels were found and correlated with the frequency of CMV antigen-expressing PBMC, suggesting a critical role of TNF-alpha in CMV activation. We speculate that active, subclinical CMV infection may be of pathophysiological importance in psoriasis.

Impact of laparoscopy with carbon dioxide versus helium on local and systemic inflammation in an animal model of peritonitis.	Increased intraperitoneal pressure and insufflation of carbon dioxide during laparoscopy may cause sepsis by promoting systemic inflammation in patients with intra-abdominal inflammatory diseases. The influence of carbon dioxide and helium during laparoscopy on bacteremia, endotoxemia, the plasma concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-alpha secretion ex vivo by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and intraperitoneal abscess formation was investigated in an animal model. A standardized fecal inoculum was injected intraperitoneally, and rats underwent laparoscopy with either carbon dioxide (N = 20) or helium (N = 20) or no further manipulation (control group; N = 20). Bacteremia was significantly more common 1 hour after laparoscopy with CO2 than in animals receiving helium or the control group. Furthermore, helium use led to a significant decrease of bacteremia 1 week after intervention. Fecal inoculation caused significant leukocytopenia in all groups within 1 hour after intervention, with complete recovery only in the helium-treated group (p < 0.05). The TNF-alpha plasma concentration was significantly lower in the helium-treated group, and suppression of ex vivo production recovered only in the animals undergoing laparoscopy with helium (p < 0.05). The number of intraperitoneal abscesses was significantly lower after laparoscopy with helium (2+/-1.5) than after CO2 laparoscopy (6.3+/-5.1) or in the control group (5.2+/-4.8). Laparoscopy with CO2 increased systemic inflammation only slightly, while helium use was associated with a significant lower incidence of bacteremia and local and systemic inflammation compared with the control group.

Brain IL-1beta increases neutrophil and decreases lymphocyte counts through stimulation of neuroimmune pathways.	Leukocytosis after cerebral injury is well described and may participate in the generation of cerebral damage. However, the mechanisms of brain-induced leukocytosis are still speculative. Since it is known that proinflammatory cytokines are involved in neuroimmunomodulation and since others and we have demonstrated high cytokine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid following injury, we supposed that brain cytokines may also influence leukocyte counts. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we established an animal model using continuous intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), intrahypothalamic (i.h.), or intravenous infusion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1beta. Controls received vehicle solution. With this experimental paradigm we could show that i.c.v. and i.h. infusion of IL-1beta but not TNF-alpha dramatically increased neutrophil counts, whereas lymphocytes dropped. Blocking the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by hypophysectomy abolished the neutrophilia, whereas the lymphopenia remained unchanged. Furthermore, application of the beta2-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol prevented the decrease of lymphocytes and diminished the neutrophilia. All parameters normalized within 48 h after termination of infusion. So, our results demonstrate that brain IL-1beta can modify blood leukocyte counts through stimulation of both the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the HPA axis.

Endotoxin and immune activation in chronic heart failure: a prospective cohort study.	"Immune activation in patients with chronic heart failure may be secondary to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) action. We investigated the hypothesis that altered gut permeability with bacterial translocation and endotoxaemia would be increased in patients with oedema secondary to congestive heart failure.
We compared 20 patients who had chronic heart failure with recent-onset peripheral oedema (mean age 64 years [SD 10], New York Heart Association [NYHA] class 3.3 [0.7]), 20 stable non-oedematous patients with chronic heart failure (mean age 63 years [19], NYHA class 2.6 [0.7]), and 14 healthy volunteers (mean age 55 years [16]). Biochemical markers of endotoxaemia, inflammation, and immune activation were measured. Ten patients were studied within 1 week of complete resolution of oedema. Five patients survived longer than 6 months and were restudied again after remaining free of oedema for more than 3 months.
Mean endotoxin concentrations were higher in oedematous patients with chronic heart failure than in stable patients with chronic heart failure (0.74 [SD 0.45] vs 0.37 EU/mL [0.23], p=0.0009) and controls (0.46 EU/mL [0.21], p=0.02). Oedematous patients had the highest concentrations of several cytokines. After short-term diuretic treatment, endotoxin concentrations decreased from 0.84 EU/mL [0.49] to 0.45 EU/mL [0.21], p<0.05) but cytokines remained raised. After freedom of oedema for more than 3 months after oedema resolved, endotoxin concentrations remained unchanged from the previous visit (0.49 EU/mL [0.06], p=0.45).
Raised concentrations of endotoxin and cytokines are found in patients with chronic heart failure during acute oedematous exacerbation. Intensified diuretic treatment can normalise endotoxin concentrations. Our preliminary findings suggest that endotoxin may trigger immune activation in patients with chronic heart failure during oedematous episodes."

Crosstalk between keratinocytes and T lymphocytes via Fas/Fas ligand interaction: modulation by cytokines.	Apoptosis mediated by Fas/FasL interaction plays an important role during many inflammatory skin disorders. To estimate whether the expression of FasL, the ligand for Fas, might be regulated by cytokines we stimulated primary human keratinocytes with several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Keratinocytes cultured to subconfluence expressed FasL constitutively. Cells stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-15, respectively, increased significantly their intracellular as well as cell surface-bound FasL expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This cytokine-induced FasL expression was dependent on new protein synthesis. Despite enhanced expression of cell surface-bound FasL, no release of soluble FasL was measured in the cell supernatants determined by ELISA. Stimulation of the cells with IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-beta1, and GM-CSF did not modulate the constitutive FasL expression, but IFN-gamma-mediated FasL up-regulation was significantly diminished by IL-10 and TGF-beta1, respectively. Up-regulation of FasL on IFN-gamma-stimulated keratinocytes led to increased apoptosis within monolayers cultured for 48 h. Moreover, coculture experiments performed with Fas+ Jurkat T cells revealed that enhanced FasL expression on IFN-gamma-stimulated keratinocytes induced apoptosis in cocultured T cells, demonstrating that up-regulated FasL was functionally active. In summary, our data suggest the important regulatory role of cytokine-controlled Fas/FasL interaction in the cross-talk between keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating T cells for maintenance of homeostasis in inflammatory skin processes.

[Transplantation immunology].	"Allogeneic grafts can be immunologically attacked by different rejection types: hyperacute, accelerated, acute, and chronic rejection. The introduction of the ""crossmatch"" before transplantation into the clinical routine completely prevents the hyperacute rejection. The development of new immunosuppressive agents, which are just approved, will make the management of accelerated rejection more efficient, too. Modern immunosuppressive agents are very efficient in the prevention of early acute rejection. In order to delay or even to prevent development of chronic rejection, the diagnostic of early and late acute rejection has to be improved. The clinically symptomless CMV infection is a very important risk factor of chronic rejection and an antiviral therapy can prevent acceleration of chronic rejection by CMV. We had to learn that CMV and other viral infection are not only a problem of the early post-transplant course. Another approach for prevention of chronic rejection is the reduction and control of unspecific inflammatory processes triggered peri-operatively by ischemia/reperfusion injury."

Genomic organization of the gene coding for TIRC7, a novel membrane protein essential for T cell activation.	A novel human membrane protein, TIRC7, was recently identified and demonstrated to be essential in T cell activation. Here we report on the genomic organization of the TIRC7 gene, which is composed of 15 exons and spans 7.9 kb. The seven predicted transmembrane-spanning domains of the TIRC7 protein coincide well with exon-intron boundaries. TIRC7 and OC116, a recently described putative subunit of the vacuolar proton pump that was demonstrated to be expressed in an osteoclastoma tumor as well as in a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, are demonstrated to be alternative transcripts of the same gene. OC116 consists of 20 exons with the last 14 introns and exons being identical with those of TIRC7. The chromosomal locus for both transcripts was identified on chromosome 11q13.4-q13.5. In human alloactivated T lymphocytes, mRNA expression of TIRC7, but not OC116, is demonstrated, indicating that OC116 is not involved in regular T cell proliferation.

[The influence of alanyl-glutamine on immunologic functions and morbidity in postoperative total parenteral nutrition. Preliminary results of a prospective randomized trial].	Glutamine seems to play an important role in metabolism and function of immunologic cells and therefore could also influence postoperative immunosuppression in surgical patients. Nevertheless, the influence of glutamine substitution in postoperative total parenteral nutrition on immunologic function and postoperative morbidity of patients is still unknown. Therefore, the impact of glutamine substitution on postoperative immunosuppression and incidence of complications was investigated in patients with surgical interventions on esophagus or stomach and total parenteral nutrition in a prospective randomized trial. To analyse the immunologic competence of the patients, the expression of CD-3, CD-4, and CD-8 on lymphocytes as well as the expression of HLA-DR and CD-14 on monocytes were evaluated before, 1, 2, 4, 7 days after surgery. Furthermore, plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were analysed during the perioperative course. Actually, 34 patients have been included (with glutamine: n = 18 vs. without glutamine: n = 16) in the study. Patients with glutamine substitution showed non significantly decreased systemic inflammation (IL-6-plasma levels, leucocytosis) and significantly faster compensation of postoperative immunosuppression (HLA-DR-monocytes). Incidence of postoperative complications was decreased after glutamine substitution compared with the control group. Patients without postoperative complications showed no significant difference in postoperative immunosuppression. Although additional substitution of the amino acid glutamine might possibly decrease incidence of postoperative complications in patients with total parenteral nutrition a general advantage in postoperative immune function could not be demonstrated.

The human homolog of Drosophila cornichon protein is differentially expressed in alloactivated T-cells.	To identify novel genes induced in the early stage of T-cell activation, mRNA expression in alloactivated human lymphocytes was examined. Differential display-reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed a 207-bp cDNA fragment which was upregulated 24 h after allostimulation of a human T-cell line. The corresponding complete 1396 bp cDNA, named TGAM77, encodes a predicted 134 amino acid protein which shares 63% homology with the cornichon (cni) protein of Drosophila melanogaster. Upregulation of TGAM77 mRNA in the early phase of T-cell activation was confirmed by Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of activated human lymphocytes. TGAM77 mRNA is expressed in a variety of human tissues with various expression levels. In analogy to cni which is involved in an epidermal growth factor-like signaling pathway inducing cellular asymmetry in Drosophila oogenesis, TGAM77 might function in similar signaling establishing vectorial re-localization and concentration of signaling events in T-cell activation.

A synthetic mimic of a discontinuous binding site on interleukin-10.	We synthetically reconstructed a discontinuous binding site on interleukin-10 (IL-10) that recognizes the neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody CB/RS/1. To design the 32-mer IL-10 mimic, a discontinuous interaction site on IL-10 was mapped, and binding studies with epitope-derived peptides led to specific replacement of several amino acids. Both parts of the interaction site were combined by addition of a linker molecule. Systematic analoging of the combined molecule then led to introduction of several additional substitutions in both regions and the linker. All possible disulfide bridge-containing variants of the 32-mer were tested by binding studies. Parallel syntheses were performed on continuous cellulose membranes by spot synthesis. As a result, a conformationally stabilized IL-10-derived molecule was obtained that both binds to and neutralizes the biological activity of CB/RS/1 in the low nanomolar range. This synthetic approach is a powerful alternative to phage display methods for the design of protein mimics.

[Interleukin-10 in dermatology].	In recent years the investigation of cytokines has been a focus of scientific interest in order to understand the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. In additions cytokines are increasingly being used for therapeutic purposes, including dermatologic disorders. IL-10 is a recently described cytokine with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive qualities which plays an important role in immunoregulation. The overexpression of this mediator has been proven in some inflammatory dermatoses as well as in various skin tumors. These observations help to understand down regulatory events in hyper-inflammatory conditions such as allergic or toxic dermatitis on the one hand and the suppression of an adequate anti-tumor response and thereby the progression of malignant tumors on the other hand. Recent investigations indicate a relative IL-10 deficiency in psoriasis. Initial therapeutic applications of IL-10 in psoriasis underline the pathophysiological importance of this cytokine.

Interleukin 10 treatment of psoriasis: clinical results of a phase 2 trial.	"To determine the safety and clinical effects of interleukin 10 (IL-10) treatment of psoriasis.
In an open-label phase 2 trial, 10 patients with psoriasis subcutaneously received recombinant human IL-10 over a 7-week period in a dosage of 8 microg/kg daily (n=5) or 20 microg/kg 3 times per week (n=5). Patients were followed up for an additional 5 weeks.
The treatment was well tolerated. Antipsoriatic effects were found in all but 1 patient. A significant decrease of the psoriasis area and severity index by 55.3% +/- 11.5% (mean +/- SEM) was observed (P<.02). The antipsoriatic efficiency was confirmed by histological examination. Heterogeneity in the effectiveness was found among the patients, but seems to be independent of the dosage regimen. However, a tendency to a better response was found in the patients who received 20-microg/kg IL-10 3 times per week. Decreasing response in the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against recall antigens indicated immunosuppressive effects. Moderate effects on hematopoietic cells were observed.
Our data suggest that IL-10 therapy for psoriasis is safe and possibly clinically effective. Consequently, its value in psoriasis and similar immune diseases should be further determined. Dose-finding, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials are necessary now."

[Immune stimulation with G-CSF (Neupogen) in septic patients with immune paralysis].	Ten patients with sepsis (HLA-DR+ monocytes < 30%) were treated with G-CSF (300 mg Filgrastin, Neupogen 30, Amgen). All patients showed a rise in HLA-DR+ monocytes during therapy. In six patients the high level of HLA-DR+ monocytes persisted after therapy; these patients survived. In the other four patients the number of HLA-DR+ monocytes declined after application of G-CSF, and the patients died of multiorgan failure. Some patients with sepsis might profit from immunestimulating therapy with G-CSF, but further studies are needed to prove whether or not this is true.	Langenbecks Archiv fur Chirurgie. Supplement.

[Effect of alanyl-glutamine in postoperative total parenteral nutrition on postoperative immunosuppression and morbidity. Preliminary results of a prospective randomized study].	The impact of glutamine substitution on postoperative immunosuppression and morbidity was investigated in patients with surgical interventions and total parenteral nutrition in a prospective randomized trial. To analyze immune competence, the expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8 on lymphocytes and of HLA-DR and CD14 on monocytes as well as the plasma levels of IL-6 and IL-10 was evaluated before, 1, 2, 4, and 7 days after surgery. A total of 34 patients have been included (with glutamine: n = 18; without glutamine: n = 16). Patients with glutamine substitution showed decreased systemic inflammation, significant faster compensation for postoperative immunosuppression and a lower incidence of postoperative complications. Patients without postoperative complications showed no significant differences in postoperative immunosuppression.	Langenbecks Archiv fur Chirurgie. Supplement. Kongressband.

CD45RA(bright)/CD11a(bright) CD8+ T cells: effector T cells.	An important aspect of peripheral T cell development is the differentiation from naive into memory cells. To distinguish naive from memory cells, CD45RA and CD11a are commonly used: CD45RA+ or CD11a(dim) T cells are regarded as naive, while CD45RA- or CD11a(bright) T cells are thought to be of memory type. There is, however, a CD8+ T cell subset which is CD45RA+ and at the same time CD11a(bright). It increases with age and in patients with systemic viral infections, though its functional role in the immune response is unknown. In the present study, we give evidence that this subset is related to memory-like T cells as it produces IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, contains high levels of perforin, and expresses CD95 in the same way as memory-type CD45RA-/CD11a(bright) CD8+ T cells. Since it contains a high percentage of CD28- and CD57+ cells, is increased in size and granularity, and is transiently expressed following in vitro stimulation of naive CD8+ T cells, we speculate that this subset mainly represents recently activated effector T cells that are able to interact with CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2 respectively) negative tissue cells.

Treatment of humoral rejection after heart transplantation.	"Until a few years ago, the incidence of humoral rejection after heart transplantation was underestimated. These episodes were frequently very aggressive and often fatal, because the maintenance and emergency immunosuppression available at the time only inadequately covered the humoral branch of the immune response. In spite of individual case reports, the effects of blood purification procedures or cyclophosphamide in this situation can only be insufficiently estimated.
To evaluate this therapy concept, 20 dog-lymphocyte-antigen-matched dogs underwent heterotopic neck-heart transplantation. Fourteen dogs underwent transplantation after having been previously sensitized through multiple skin transplantations, 6 dogs were not sensitized (control). The animals received an induction with 3x 250 mg prednisolone, as well as triple immunosuppression (cyclosporine, azathioprine, and cortisone). Biopsy (light microscopy, immunofluorescence), intramyocardial voltage, electric myocardial impedance (>200 kHz, <10 kHz), and echocardiographic (left ventricular wall thickness, diastolic relaxation velocity) examinations were performed daily to monitor rejection. Rejection therapy was continued for 3 days according to the following regimen: apheresis, cortisone boluses (CB), and cyclophosphamide in group A1 (n = 4), apheresis and CB without cyclophosphamide in group A2 (n = 4), and CB only in group C (n = 6). The subsequent course under triple immunosuppression was then observed.
In the sensitized animals the onset of severe humoral rejection on the fifth day deteriorated cardiac function down to 75% (70% to 80%) of the initial values. In groups A1 and A2, apheresis resulted in recovery to near-control values (89% to 94%) within two hours, and indeed to complete recovery (97% to 101%) after the second apheresis, that is, within 1 day. In group C recovery was delayed (2 days) and incomplete (84% to 91 %). After therapy was discontinued, rejection-related functional deterioration recurred immediately in group C, and from 2 to 3 days after apheresis, regardless of whether cyclophosphamide therapy was performed (group A1) or not (group A2). In the control group all animals showed a rejection-free posttransplantation course.
By diluting inflammatory mediators, apheresis leads to a rapid improvement in cardiac function during severe humoral rejection after head transplantation. Neither apheresis nor cyclophosphamide therapy are able to have an immediate positive influence on the activation of the immune cascade and to prevent an ongoing rejection."

Brain-IL-1beta induces local inflammation but systemic anti-inflammatory response through stimulation of both hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system.	It is well established that systemic inflammation induces a counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory response particularly resulting in deactivation of monocytes/macrophages. However, recently we demonstrated a systemic anti-inflammatory response without preceding signs of systemic inflammation in patients with brain injury/surgery and release of cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In order to analyze the mechanisms and pathways of systemic immunodepression resulting from sterile cerebral inflammation we established an animal model using continuous intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) or intra-hypothalamic (i.h.) infusion of rat recombinant (rr) tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta for 48 h. Controls received intra-venous (i.v.) cytokine administration. Interestingly, i.c.v. and i.h. infusion of IL-1beta but not TNF-alpha produced distinct signs of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Correspondingly, i.c.v. infusion of IL-1beta particularly diminished the TNF-alpha but increased the IL-10 concentration in whole blood cultures after endotoxin stimulation. All parameters normalized within 48 h after termination of the infusion. Blocking the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by hypophysectomy (HPX) led to complete recovery of the diminished TNF-alpha concentration and temporarily inhibited the IL-10 increase. Blocking the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) transmission by application of the beta2-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol not only inhibited the increase but further downregulated the endotoxin induced IL-10 concentration in the media of whole blood cell cultures, whereas the TNF-alpha decrease was only partially prevented. Interestingly, HPX and propranolol also diminished the cell invasion into the CSF. In summary, activation of both the HPA axis and the SNS plays an important role in systemic anti-inflammatory response resulting from cytokines in brain and cerebral inflammation.

Cytokines and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.	Cytokines are considered to be of major importance for the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). Their impact may result from autocrine, paracrine or endocrine effects. Several investigations demonstrated the overexpression of different cytokines in different CTCL entities. Interestingly, stage-dependent shifts in the cytokine pattern have been observed in mycosis fungoides (MF). There is evidence that the abnormal cytokine expression in CTCL might be responsible for tumor progression, resulting from an enhanced proliferation of the malignant cells and/or the depression of the anti-tumor immune response. Moreover, cytokine loops might explain phenomena like the epidermotropism of malignant cells or eosinophilia and increased plasma levels of IgE, which are present in advanced stages of CTCL. Analysis of the cytokine pattern in CTCL might give the basis for direct therapeutic intervention into the cytokine network as a new therapeutic approach. In this review, the current knowledge regarding cytokines in CTCL is summarized.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encephalitis in an immunocompetent young person and diagnostic reliability of HCMV DNA PCR using cerebrospinal fluid of nonimmunosuppressed patients.	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encephalitis in adult nonimmunosuppressed patients has rarely been reported. We have diagnosed HCMV encephalitis in an anti-HCMV immunoglobulin G-negative, nonimmunosuppressed young woman by HCMV DNA PCR and virus isolation from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). At the same time, HCMV antigen and HCMV DNA could be demonstrated in peripheral blood leukocytes, and the virus was isolated in fibroblast cultures. After 22 days of acute illness, the virus disappeared from the CSF. Remarkably, the patient did not generate detectable anti-HCMV antibodies within 5 months after the beginning of illness. To investigate the significance of HCMV DNA detection in CSF, samples of CSF, blood cells, and serum from 35 nonimmunosuppressed patients with various neurological disorders (but no herpes simplex virus central nervous system [CNS] disease) were tested for HCMV DNA, antigen, and antibodies. Eleven of these patients were found to be positive for virus DNA and/or antigen in peripheral blood leukocytes. Additionally, HCMV DNA was detected in the CSF of two patients with noninflammatory CNS diseases. A causative role of HCMV in the CNS diseases of these two patients was not evident. In summary, HCMV DNA amplification from CSF samples is a very suitable method to verify HCMV-associated encephalitis, but it should be taken into consideration that there are few cases of positive PCR with DNA from CSF without any known clinical correlative.

Prevention of acute allograft rejection by antibody targeting of TIRC7, a novel T cell membrane protein.	A novel 75 kDa membrane protein, TIRC7, is described that exhibits a central role in T cell activation in vitro and in vivo. Modulation of TIRC7-mediated signals with specific anti-TIRC7 antibodies in vitro efficiently prevents human T cell proliferation and IL-2 secretion. Moreover, anti-TIRC7 antibodies specifically inhibit type 1 subset specific IFN-gamma expression but spare the type 2 cytokine IL-4. Diminished proliferation but not IFN-gamma secretion is reversible by exogenous rIL-2. An anti-TIRC7 antibody that cross-reacts with the 75 kDa rat homolog exhibits inhibition of rat alloimmune response in vitro and significantly prolongs kidney allograft survival in vivo. Targeting of TIRC7 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for modulation of the immune response.

Systemic inflammation in patients with heart failure.	"We hypothesized that chronic heart failure as a model of systemic hypoxia may result in systemic inflammation. The signs of a systemic inflammatory response should disappear after successful mechanical circulatory support using biventricular assist device systems.
Plasma levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha) and soluble adhesion molecules (sVCAM, sE-, sL-, sP-Selectin) were determined in samples obtained from patients with chronic heart failure NYHA classes II-III, patients with overt cardiogenic shock before and after implantation of a mechanical assist-device system ('Berlin Heart') and in patients with coronary artery disease as a control. Elevated levels of cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules could be observed in patients with cardiogenic shock, although slightly decreased levels of soluble adhesion molecules were also detectable in patients with chronic heart failure NYHA classes II-III. The signs of systemic inflammation disappeared following successful mechanical circulatory support, but persisted in patients who developed infectious complications.
Our data suggest that a systemic hypoxic and inflammatory syndrome is manifested during end-stage heart failure, such as in patients with sepsis or who have suffered non-infectious insults. During mechanical circulatory support, elevated levels of inflammatory mediators may be indicative of persistent peripheral hypoxia associated with a high risk for infection or sepsis. Therefore, the monitoring of inflammatory mediators should be evaluated as markers of the effectiveness of this therapy."

Prompt treatment of initial acute rejection episodes may improve long-term graft outcome.	Acute rejection episodes have been cited as a major immunological risk factor for the development of chronic rejection. To examine the influence of a single rejection event on ultimate graft outcome, acutely rejection rat kidney grafts were retransplanted sequentially into syngeneic rats and their functional and structural behavior assessed over time Early structural changes (days 3 and 4) were completely reversible, while signs of chronic rejection did become obvious during the long-term follow up. More advanced deteriorated grafts (days 5 and 7) were irreversibly damaged and the rats died shortly after retransplantation. Those results indicate the critical impact of acute rejection episodes on chronic graft rejection. Immediate and aggressive treatment of acute rejection episodes may remove this event as a risk factor for late deteriorating changes.

Sympathetic activation triggers systemic interleukin-10 release in immunodepression induced by brain injury.	The mechanism of immunodepression after brain injury is not yet clear. Here we demonstrate rapid systemic release of the immunoinhibitory cytokine interleukin-10, monocytic deactivation and a high incidence of infection in patients with 'sympathetic storm' due to acute accidental or iatrogenic brain trauma. In vitro studies showed that within minutes catecholamines trigger the secretion of interleukin-10 from unstimulated monocytes through a beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated, cAMP/protein kinase A-dependent pathway. We found that in a rat model of acute brain injury, the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol prevented the increase of interleukin-10 plasma levels. Rapid monocytic interleukin-10 release after sympathetic activation may represent a common pathway for immunodepression induced by stress and injury.

"Thymus requirement and antigen dependency in the ""infectious"" tolerance pathway in transplant recipients."	"We have shown that features of infectious tolerance, as originally described in thymectomized mice, may be applied to euthymic rat recipients of heart transplants. We now report on studies aimed at exposing mechanisms underlying the infectious tolerance pathway, with emphasis on the role of thymus and alloantigen. Pretransplant thymectomy diminished the efficacy of CD4-targeted therapy, with donor-specific tolerance induced in approximately 50% of recipients. Thymus was required for generation of regulatory T cells under the cover of CD4 mAb therapy and for the ability of these cells to confer infectious tolerance. However, thymus was not mandatory to maintain an infectious-permissive environment in cohorts of adoptively transferred recipients. Intragraft expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 genes was diminished in euthymic and thymectomized tolerant hosts. However, grafts in the latter group showed significant IFN-gamma gene expression, suggesting a less efficient down-regulation of Th1-like cells in the absence of regulatory cells. Indeed, exogenous challenge with rIL-2 or freshly alloactivated spleen cells recreated rejection in thymectomized, but not euthymic, hosts, suggesting that a state of cytokine-responsive anergy contributes to the ""noninfectious"" form of tolerance in thymectomized rats. The infection-tolerant state did not result from ""graft adaptation,"" and regulatory T cells restricted for the original alloantigen were exposed to its continuous stimulation. The effective memory for suppression was dependent upon persistent donor-specific alloantigen stimulation; it disappeared within 3 weeks after its removal. Hence, both central and peripheral immune mechanisms, orchestrated by the tolerizing alloantigen, contribute to the infectious tolerance pathway in CD4 mAb-treated rat transplant recipients."

Diminished monocytic HLA-DR expression and ex vivo cytokine secretion capacity in patients with glioblastoma: effect of tumor extirpation.	Severe immunodysregulation on lymphocyte level has been described in patients with glioblastoma and is likely involved into its unfavorable prognosis. Although the major importance of monocytic cells for immunoregulation is well established, only very limited data exist regarding the monocyte status in glioblastoma patients. Here we demonstrate a markedly diminished monocytic HLA-DR expression and ex vivo cytokine secretion capacity (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-10) as signs for monocyte deactivation in glioblastoma patients but not in patients with astrocytoma. As known in immunocompromised patients from other reasons, monocyte deactivation indicate global immunodepression associated with an enhanced risk of infectious complications. Interestingly, tumor resection resulted in partial recovery from the monocytic deactivation. This suggests that the glioblastoma itself contributed to this phenomenon. However, IL-10 and the active forms of transforming growth factor-beta2 and -beta1, which are produced by glioblastoma cells and known to inhibit monocyte function, were not detectable in plasma in our patients. Moreover, low levels of the adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol excluded hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis involvement. So, further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanism.

Intravenous injection of India ink with suicidal intent.	We describe the case of a 33-year-old man who injected 4 ml of India ink into one of the median cubital veins with suicidal intent. He was hospitalized in good general condition 10 h after the injection. Abnormal laboratory test results were a leukocytosis, an oximetrically determined methemoglobin level of 36.9% (normal range: 1.5%) and a free hemoglobin level of 74 mumol/L (normal range: < 25 mumol/L). Toxicological examination showed the presence of nitrobenzene in blood and urine. Intravenous administration of vitamin C and tolonium chloride plus forced diuresis led to an improvement in cyanosis and a fall in the methemoglobin concentration. Repeated increase in the concentration of aminobenzene were successfully treated by hemodialysis with a high-flux dialyzer.

Mapping of the interleukin-10/interleukin-10 receptor combining site.	The discontinuous interleukin-10(IL-10)/interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) combining site was mapped using sets of overlapping peptides derived from both binding partners bound to continuous cellulose membranes. Low affinity binding of single regions of the discontinuous contact sites on IL-10 and IL-10R could be identified due to (1) high peptide density on the membrane support, (2) incubation with high protein concentrations, (3) indirect immunodetection of the ligates after electrotransfer onto polyvinylene difluoride membranes, and (4) use of highly overlapping peptide scans of different length (6-mers and 15-mers). The single binding regions identified for each protein species are separated in the protein sequences, but form continuous areas on the surface of IL-10 (X-ray structure) and IL-10R (computer model). Furthermore, four epitopes of neutralizing anti-IL-10 and anti-IL-10R antibodies were mapped and overlap with these binding regions. Soluble peptides (15- to 19-mers) each spanning one of the three identified IL-10-derived receptor binding regions displayed no significant affinity to IL-10R as expected, whereas a peptide (35-mer) comprising two of these regions had considerably higher binding activity. The data are consistent with a previously published computer model of the IL-10/IL-10R complex. This approach should be generally applicable for the mapping of non-linear protein-protein contact sites.

Blockade of very late antigen-4 integrin binding to fibronectin in allograft recipients: I. Treatment with connecting segment-1 peptides prevents acute rejection by suppressing intragraft mononuclear cell accumulation, endothelial activation, and cytokine expression.	"Allograft rejection is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells and local deposition of fibronectin (FN). This study was carried out to examine the hypothesis that peptides known to specifically block adhesive interactions between the connecting segment-1 (CS1)-binding domain of FN and alpha4beta1 integrin on circulating cells may interfere with the immune cascade, which would lead to acute rejection in transplant recipients.
Cardiac allografts from Lewis x Brown Norway F1 hybrids were rejected in 7+/-1 days in Lewis rats. Treatment with bioactive CS1 peptides (4 mg/kg/day i.v. for 7 days) abrogated acute rejection and prolonged cardiac allograft survival to 13+/-1 days (P<0.001). This effect correlated with decreased expression of total fibronectin and cell adhesion molecules, such as alpha4beta1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, as well as reduced infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the graft site. Treatment with CS1 peptides decreased alloantigen activation, as evidenced by decreased intragraft infiltration by CD25+ cells, and diminished expression of mRNA coding for Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2, interferon-gamma)- and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6)-type cytokines. CS1-mediated immunosuppressive effects could be reversed and acute rejection recreated after adjunctive treatment of rats with recombinant IL-2.
Our data are consistent with the model in which in vivo interaction between the alpha4beta1 integrin receptor and the cell-associated CS1 motif of FN is critical for rejection cascade. The novel therapeutic approach of selectively blocking the alpha4beta1-FN activation pathway with CS1 peptides prevents acute allograft rejection by inhibiting expansion of antigen-specific T cells and inducing a transient state of cytokine-responsive anergy in the residual T-cell population."

Increased systemic inflammation after laparotomy vs laparoscopy in an animal model of peritonitis.	"To study the influence of laparotomy and laparoscopy on local and systemic inflammation in a rat model of peritonitis.
Bacteremia, peripheral leukocyte subpopulations, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) plasma levels, and ex vivo secretion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were investigated after laparotomy and laparoscopy in a prospective randomized experimental study.
Surgical department of a university hospital.
60 male inbred Wistar rats.
Standardized fecal inoculum was injected intraperitoneally and rats underwent laparotomy (n=20), laparoscopy (n=20), or no further manipulation (control group, n=20). Blood samples were obtained during the perioperative course to determine bacteremia, leukocytic subpopulations, TNF-alpha plasma levels, and ex vivo secretion. The number of intraperitoneal abscesses was determined in each animal after 1 week.
The hypothesis of the experiment was that laparoscopy with carbon dioxide leads to an increase of local and systemic inflammation in comparison with the laparotomy and control groups.
One hour after intervention, bacteremia was significantly higher in the laparotomy and laparoscopy groups compared with the control group (P=.01). Fecal inoculum caused significant monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia in all groups within 1 hour after intervention (P<.05), with complete recovery on day 2 only in the laparoscopy and control groups. Laparotomy caused a significant increase in TNF-alpha plasma levels and decrease of ex vivo production of TNF-alpha compared with the other 2 groups (P<.05).

IL-10 is a key cytokine in psoriasis. Proof of principle by IL-10 therapy: a new therapeutic approach.	Overexpression of proinflammatory, type 1 cytokines has been demonstrated in psoriasis and is believed to be of pathophysiological importance. IL-10 is a type 2 cytokine with major impact on immunoregulation, since it inhibits type 1/proinflammatory cytokine formation. Therefore, we investigated its role in psoriasis. We found a relative deficiency in cutaneous IL-10 mRNA expression compared with other inflammatory dermatoses. Interestingly, patients during established antipsoriatic therapy showed higher IL-10 mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than patients before therapy. This suggested that IL-10 may have antipsoriatic capacity. Therefore, we performed a phase 2 pilot trial with subcutaneous IL-10 administration (8 microg/kg/d) over 24 d in three patients. Clinical efficiency measured by objective and subjective parameters was found. Immunosuppressive effects (depressed monocytic HLA-DR expression, TNF-alpha and IL-12 secretion capacity, IL-12 plasma levels, and responsiveness to recall antigens) as well as a shift toward a type 2 cytokine pattern (increasing proportion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 producing T cells, selective increase in IgE serum levels) were observed. Remarkably, IL-10 administration also enhanced the intracutaneous IL-10 mRNA expression. Our investigations demonstrate the major importance of IL-10 in psoriasis and show that IL-10 administration represents a new therapeutic approach. This is the first report on IL-10 therapy for cutaneous disorders.

Contribution of early acute rejection episodes to chronic rejection in a rat kidney retransplantation model.	Chronic graft rejection represents the single most important risk factor for unsatisfactory long-term results after organ transplantation. In addition to various alloantigen dependent and independent factors, acute rejection episodes have been cited as a major immunological risk factor. However, the effects of acute rejection episodes on long-term graft outcome remains unknown. To examine the influence of a single early rejection event on ultimate graft outcome, acutely rejecting rat kidney grafts were retransplanted sequentially into syngeneic rats and their functional and structural behavior assessed over time. LEWxBNF1 kidney allografts and LEW isografts were removed from their LEW recipients after three, four, five and seven days (N = 12/group/time period) and retransplanted into donor strain hosts. The grafts were followed functionally and harvested four, eight, and 32 weeks later. Urinary protein excretion was measured weekly. Kidneys were examined morphologically and immunohistologically using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against macrophages (ED-1), T cells and their subsets (CD5, CD4, CD8), MHC class II expression (OX3) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and LFA-1alpha). The mean standard time +/- SD of non-retransplanted allografts was 14.5 +/- two days; isografts functioned indefinitely. At five and seven days, acutely rejecting allografts showed massive cellular infiltrates associated with extensive necrosis. These changes could not be reversed by retransplantation and the syngeneic recipients later died of renal failure. In contrast, most allografts retransplanted earlier in the process recovered completely when retransplanted after three (12 of 12 allografts) and four (7 of 12 allografts) days. During the subsequent follow-up period, urinary protein excretion was comparable in retransplanted allografts and isografts. The increased mononuclear cell infiltration in non-retransplanted allografts seen at three and four days was only occasionally observed during the follow-up period after retransplantation. Only a few sclerosed glomeruli (approximately 15%), mild arterial changes and minimal cellular infiltrates were observed by 32 weeks, which were similar to that seen in retransplanted isografts. A single acute rejection episode was completely reversible and did not progress to chronic rejection if retransplanted into syngeneic donors when the inflammatory changes are still early. Those results demonstrate the critical effect of alloantigen-dependent events on chronic graft deterioration, and indicate that prompt and aggressive treatment of initial acute rejection episodes are beneficial to protect against late deleterious changes in the graft.

Colour-coded duplex sonography in the diagnostic assessment of vascular complications after kidney transplantation in children.	"Vascular complications are a major cause of dysfunction or transplant loss in children. Arterial or venous occlusion, transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) and some arteriovenous (AV) fistula require rapid detection and prompt intervention. The present study was performed to determine the accuracy of colour Doppler sonography (CDS) in the early and late phase after renal transplantation and to correlate the results with angiographic and intraoperative findings.
CDS is the preferred imaging modality with a high diagnostic accuracy for follow-up of renal transplantation in children. The indication for angiography should be established on the basis of the CDS diagnosis.
In 87 children (mean age 10.9 years, range 2-17), 423 CDS examinations were performed after renal transplantation. Angiography was performed in 17 cases; surgery was necessary in 16 patients.
CDS correctly identified 8/8 arterial or venous occlusions and 7/7 TRAS. The only false positive diagnosis of TRAS was due to misinterpretation of an iliac artery stenosis. Six AV fistulae were diagnosed by CDS. The overall positive predictive value of CDS was 94 % in this study.
CDS is a noninvasive, non-radiation producing imaging modality with a high diagnostic accuracy. It is the method of choice in the assessment of vascular complications after renal transplantation in children."

Hyperventilation induces release of cytokines from perfused mouse lung.	Artificial mechanical ventilation represents a major cause of iatrogenic lung damage in intensive care. It is largely unknown which mediators, if any, contribute to the onset of such complications. We investigated whether stress caused by artificial mechanical ventilation leads to induction, synthesis, and release of cytokines or eicosanoids from lung tissue. We used the isolated perfused and ventilated mouse lung where frequent perfusate sampling allows determination of mediator release into the perfusate. Hyperventilation was executed with either negative (NPV) or positive pressure ventilation (PPV) at a transpulmonary pressure that was increased 2.5-fold above normal. Both modes of hyperventilation resulted in an approximately 1.75-fold increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA, but not of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA. After switching to hyperventilation, prostacyclin release into the perfusate increased almost instantaneously from 19 +/- 17 pg/min to 230 +/- 160 pg/min (PPV) or 115 +/- 87 pg/min (NPV). The enhancement in TNFalpha and IL-6 production developed more slowly. In control lungs after 150 min of perfusion and ventilation, TNFalpha and IL-6 production was 23 +/- 20 pg/min and 330 +/- 210 pg/min, respectively. In lungs hyperventilated for 150 min, TNFalpha and IL-6 production were increased to 287 +/- 180 pg/min and more than 1,000 pg/min, respectively. We conclude that artificial ventilation might cause pulmonary and systemic adverse reactions by inducing the release of mediators into the circulation.

Influence of monomethylfumarate on monocytic cytokine formation--explanation for adverse and therapeutic effects in psoriasis?	Although the effectiveness of systemic antipsoriatic treatment with fumaric acid esters has been proven, their mode of action is still not understood. Recent results indicate their potency in inducing cytokine production in stimulated T cells. Since monocytes and their cytokines are also considered to be of pathogenic importance in psoriasis, we investigated the effect of monomethylfumarate (MMF) on proinflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-12) and antiinflammatory (IL-10, IL-1RA) cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and separated monocytes. In 24-h PBMC cultures from both psoriatic patients (n = 6-13) and healthy volunteers (n = 7-9), MMF at 100 microM induced secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-10, and IL-1RA. Kinetics of IL-10 protein and mRNA expression indicated de novo production. Moreover, MMF significantly augmented endotoxin-induced synthesis of TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-1RA. In contrast, no influence on IL-12 secretion was found. Similar effects of MMF in purified monocytes indicated these cells to be responsible for aberrant cytokine formation. Furthermore, enhanced expression of costimulatory molecules after MMF stimulation confirmed monocyte activation. Multiple restimulation with fumaric acid esters in vitro, however, and immunomonitoring in a patient during Fumaderm initial therapy suggested that initial monocyte activation is followed by subsequent deactivation associated with an antiinflammatory response. Our results may explain the well-known effects of therapy with fumaric acid esters. Thus, initial treatment is often accompanied by adverse effects which may be caused by MMF-induced TNF-alpha formation. The change in the IL-10/IL-12 balance as a result of elective induction of IL-10, however, may have antipsoriatic activity by diminishing type-1/proinflammatory cytokine over-expression and the antigen-presenting capacity of monocytes/macrophages, and by upregulation of IL-1RA.

Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody-induced allograft tolerance in rats despite persistence of donor-reactive T cells.	Although CD4-targeted therapy abrogates acute rejection and may induce permanent graft acceptance in rodents, little is known about the mechanisms of long-term graft survival in these models. Recently, we have shown that treatment with a nondepleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (RIB-5/2) induces long-term survival of renal, heart, and skin allografts in strong major histocompatibility complex I/II incompatible rat strains. Here, we demonstrate that the development of major histocompatibility complex-specific and tissue-nonspecific tolerance rather than graft adaptation is responsible for long-term anti-CD4 mAb-induced transplant survival. Donor-specific but not third-party heart and pancreatic islet grafts were accepted permanently without adjunctive therapy in long-term kidney allograft recipients, and infusion of naive or alloimmune splenocytes failed to break the tolerant state. Interestingly, alloreactive T cells were not depleted in these long-term survivors, as ex vivo donor-specific mixed lymphocyte reaction was largely unaffected. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses of long-term renal allografts before and after donor-specific antigen challenge revealed no changes in CD3 mRNA level, but showed up-regulation of CD25, interleukin (IL) 2, interferon (IFN) gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 mRNA in the early phase, suggesting the presence of alloreactive T cells in tolerant rats. At later time points, the expression of IFN-gamma declined rapidly, whereas IL-4 persisted, resulting in a reversal of IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio. Our data demonstrate the stability of anti-CD4 mAb-induced tolerance despite persistence of alloreactive T cells, suggesting the role of active tolerance-maintaining mechanisms. The T helper (Th) 1/Th2 shift may be involved in this regulatory process, as anti-CD4 mAb prevents acute graft-deteriorating rejection by effectively blocking Th1 responses, and well-functioning grafts may tolerize themselves by inducing regulatory cells.

Chronically rejected rat kidney allografts induce donor-specific tolerance.	Previous studies on pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic graft rejection demonstrated the impact of both alloresponsiveness and nonspecific immunological events on the process. To study the role of alloantigen-specific factors further, we hypothesized an acceleration of chronic graft rejection after presensitization. Chronically rejected renal allografts in the established Fischer 344 --> Lewis rat model were replaced sequentially by native allografts of donor origin. Grafting of second allografts was performed 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the original transplantation and followed long term. Second allografts demonstrated significantly ameliorated functional and structural alterations with few cellular infiltrates. These changes were independent from the time interval between first and second engraftment (2-12 weeks); immunosuppressive treatment after the second engraftment was not influential. The nonresponsiveness was not restricted to the second kidney allografts, as heart allografts of donor origin in these recipients also functioned indefinitely, whereas third-party grafts (Lewis x Brown Norway F1) and Fischer 344 heart grafts in untreated Lewis control rats were acutely rejected. Thus, donor-specific and tissue-nonspecific graft acceptance is achieved by second engraftment of donor-specific allografts in a model of chronic graft rejection. Those observations demonstrate the synergistic effects of alloresponsiveness and of the injured graft itself for the development of chronic graft failure.

Selective in vivo deletion of alloactivated TH1 cells by OKT3 monoclonal antibody in acute rejection.	The OKT3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the CD3 complex on human T-cells has been shown to be an effective immunosuppressive agent for the treatment and the prevention of acute rejection episodes in allograft recipients [1]. Following the initial doses of OKT3 mAb, activation of T lymphocytes and monocytes is observed. This is accompanied by a massive cytokine release, particularly following the first injection. The mAb opsonizes the circulating T-cells and the coated cells disappear quickly from circulation. OKT3 mAb is commonly administered for 5-10 days. The manifestation of side effects weeks (cytomegalovirus infection/disease, bacterial and fungal infections) or even months (Epstein-Barr-Virus related lymphoproliferative disease) after therapy as well as the good long-term effects on graft function suggest long-lasting immunosuppressive effects. Since peripheral T-cells reappear in the circulation already during therapy (with modulated CD3/T-cell receptor complex) and T-cell counts reach commonly pretreatment levels within 2-3 days after cessation of OKT3 mAb, the long-lasting immunosuppressive effects are not simply explainable by T-cell depletion. We wondered whether T-cells reappearing in the circulation after cessation of therapy, were functionally different from those before OKT3 mAb therapy. Our data suggest a selective depletion of activated T-cells particularly of type 1-like T-cells by OKT3 mAb resulting in long-lasting immune deviation that may explain the long-term effects of OKT3 mAb treatment.

Monocyte deactivation in septic patients: restoration by IFN-gamma treatment.	Neutralization of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-1 (IL-1), decreases mortality in several animal models of sepsis. However, recent clinical trials did not show an unequivocal improvement in survival. In contrast to animals, which succumb to shock during the first 72 hours, we found that many patients die much later with signs of opportunistic infections accompanied by downregulation of their monocytic HLA-DR expression and reduced ability to produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-alpha in vitro. This phenomenon of monocyte deactivation in septic patients with fatal outcome shows similarities to experimental monocytic refractoriness induced by LPS desensitization or by pretreatment with its endogenous mediators IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). In order to strengthen their antimicrobial defense, here we tested whether interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) can improve monocytic functions in these patients and in experimental monocytic deactivation. The considerably lowered in vitro levels of LPS-induced TNF-alpha in these situations were significantly enhanced by IFN-gamma, but did not reach the extremely high levels of IFN-gamma primed naive cells from healthy donors. Moreover, IFN-gamma applied to septic patients with low monocytic HLA-DR expression restored the deficient HLA-DR expression and in vitro LPS-induced TNF-alpha secretion. Recovery of monocyte function resulted in clearance of sepsis in eight of nine patients. These data suggest that IFN-gamma treatment in carefully selected septic patients is a novel therapeutic strategy worth pursuing.

Elevated soluble CD14 receptors and altered cytokines in chronic heart failure.	We hypothesized that in patients with chronic heart failure mesenteric venous congestion leads to increased bowel permeability, bacterial translocation, and thereby endotoxin release; the increased endotoxin challenge then causes immune activation with increased soluble CD14 levels and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production. Patients with high soluble CD14 levels (indicative of endotoxin-cell interaction) have markedly increased plasma levels of TNF-alpha, soluble TNF receptors 1 and 2, and intracellular adhesion molecule-1, supporting this hypothesis.

Pentoxifylline promotes replication of human cytomegalovirus in vivo and in vitro.	OKT3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) therapy is well established in the prevention and therapy of acute rejection in transplant patients. Unfortunately, this therapy is associated with several short-term (cytokine release syndrome) and long-term (infections, EBV-related lymphoma) side effects. Recently, we were able to demonstrate an association between the TNF alpha release following the first OKT3 MoAb infusions and the appearance of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation several days later. In order to prevent this TNF alpha associated HCMV reactivation patients were additionally treated with pentoxifylline (PTX), a methylxanthine derivative that has been shown to suppress TNF alpha induction. Although the TNF alpha peak plasma level following OKT3 MoAb treatment was markedly reduced, the incidence of HCMV reactivation and HCMV disease was not influenced. In transient transfection experiments using HCMV immediate early enhancer/promoter CAT reporter gene constructs PTX enhanced the promoter activity independently from TNF alpha in premonocytic cells. Furthermore, PTX acted synergistically with TNF alpha. In virus-infected human embryonal lung fibroblasts HCMV replication was triggered in the presence of both PTX and TNF alpha, while either substance alone had only marginal effects. The stimulatory effect of PTX on the immediate early (IE) enhancer/promoter was mediated via CREB/ ATF, a eukaryotic transcription factor that binds to the 19 bp sequence motif in the enhancer region, while TNF alpha stimulation was mediated by activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and its binding to the 18 bp sequence motif in the enhancer. These data suggest a potential side effect of cAMP-elevating drugs such as PTX.

Verrucosis of hands and feet in a patient with combined immune deficiency.	In immunocompromised patients, warts occur frequently and can be extensive. We describe a 24-year-old patient with severe therapy-resistant warts. In addition to human papillomavirus infection, he had chronic sinusitis, candidiasis, and atopic dermatitis. Anergy to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test reaction, significant CD4 lymphopenia, and diminished in vitro T-cell proliferative response and interferon-gamma production indicated a deficiency of cellular immunity. Extremely low concentrations of serum IgM and IgG2 and a severe deficiency of in vitro IgM production pointed also to a humoral immunodeficiency syndrome. This case represents a combination of cellular and humoral immunodeficiencies that has not been previously described in association with warts.

Enhanced expression of T-cell activation and natural killer cell antigens indicates systemic anti-tumor response in early primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.	Indolent, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are characterized by hyper-proliferation of malignant T-helper cells in the skin with a favorable prognosis in the early stages. Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are believed to be of major importance for tumor surveillance, but there is not yet sufficient evidence for a systemic anti-tumor response in mycosis fungoides (MF). On the contrary, there are hints of systemic immunodepression. We wondered whether signs of a systemic anti-tumor response were demonstrable in peripheral blood of patients with MF and CD30+ pleomorphic T cell lymphoma. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated blood samples from 39 CTCL patients at different stages and compared them with those from patients with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and healthy volunteers. In CTCL patients, an elevated number of lymphocytes expressing natural killer cell markers were found, as well as considerable T-cell activation, indicated by increased percentages of T cells expressing HLA-DR, IL-2 receptor alpha-chain, and transferrin receptor. The CD8+ T cells, which were the most strongly activated T-cell subset, were of polyclonal origin, as shown by their usage of different T-cell receptor families. The enhanced expression of activation antigens was associated with an increased proportion of CD8+ T cells with high expression of the adhesion molecule LFA-1, demonstrating the capacity for migration of these cells. These CD8+ effector cells are suspected to be CTLs and may be responsible for the favorable prognosis of indolent, primary CTCL. Interestingly, a stage-dependent decrease in T-cell activation antigen expression was observed, suggesting the development of a lack in tumor surveillance in advanced MF stages. Further investigations are necessary to verify whether any of the parameters determined are of predictive value for prognosis and response to therapy in CTCL.

Short-term hemodynamic effects of immunoadsorption in dilated cardiomyopathy.	"Previous studies have shown that the sera of many patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are positive for several antibodies directed against cardiac antigens. Anti-beta1-adrenergic receptor antibodies occur in 70% to 90% of DCM patients. These antibodies are extractable by immunoadsorption (IA). In an investigation of the functional significance of antibodies for hemodynamics, IA was performed throughout 5 consecutive days on nine patients with severe DCM who were on stable drug therapy.
Immunoglobulins were eliminated in nine patients with severe DCM (mean age, 43.5 years; range, 25 to 58 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, <25%). IA was performed over 5 consecutive days with an immunoadsorber for immunoglobulin. All patients were on stable medication, including ACE inhibitors, digitalis, and diuretics. All patients received beta-blockers. During therapy, hemodynamic parameters (mean+/-SD) were monitored with a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter. IA elicited a decrease of anti-beta1-adrenergic receptor antibodies from 6.4+/-1.3 to 1.0+/-0.5 relative units. During IA, cardiac output increased from 3.7+/-0.8 to 5.5+/-1.8 L/min, P<.01. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 76.0+/-9.9 to 65.0+/-11.2 mm Hg, P<.05; mean pulmonary arterial pressure, from 27.6+/-7.7 to 22.0+/-6.5 mm Hg, P<.05; left ventricular filling pressure, from 16.8+/-7.4 to 12.8+/-4.7 mm Hg, P<.05; and systemic vascular resistance, from 1465+/-332 to 949+/-351 dyne x s x cm(-5), P<.01.
In addition to conventional medical treatment, IA may be an additional therapeutic possibility for acute hemodynamic stabilization of patients with severe DCM."

Routine immunizations in adult renal transplant recipients.	"Vaccination guidelines for transplant recipients include regular boosters of tetanus, diphtheria, and inactivated polio vaccine, but there are few published data on the efficacy of these vaccines in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
Serum antibody values were evaluated before and 4 weeks after tetanus, diphtheria, and inactivated polio vaccination in 164 renal transplant recipients compared with healthy controls. Twelve months later, antibody levels were evaluated in 55 patients.
Prebooster tetanus antitoxin values were lower in transplant recipients than in controls. All patients developed protective tetanus antibody levels (> or = 0.01 IU/ml) after vaccination. After 12 months, serum antibodies had decreased, but all patients maintained protective values. Diphtheria antitoxin titers before and after booster vaccination were lower in patients than in controls: 88.5% of patients and 96.2% of controls developed protective diphtheria antibody values. Twelve months after vaccination, diphtheria antitoxin values were below the protective level (0.1 IU/ml) in 38% of patients. Prebooster antibody values to poliovirus types 1 and 3 were comparable in patients and controls, whereas antibodies to poliovirus type 2 were lower in transplant recipients. Seroprotection rates and geometric mean antibody titers after vaccination were equivalent between the two groups for all three poliovirus types. No difference was observed in antibody levels between patients on different immunosuppressive drug regimens. Adverse reactions were significantly less often reported by transplant recipients.
In transplant recipients, tetanus and inactivated polio vaccinations are well tolerated and induce protective antibody levels; diphtheria vaccination as currently recommended is less effective and protective antitoxin values decrease rapidly in these patients within 1 year after vaccination."

In vitro prevention and reversal of lipopolysaccharide desensitization by IFN-gamma, IL-12, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.	LPS tolerance is characterized by a diminished monocytic synthesis of TNF-alpha and, interestingly, IL-10 after LPS restimulation. We wondered whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-12, and IFN-gamma can prevent or reverse this down-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-10 production. The LPS-induced TNF-alpha amounts in desensitized PBMC treated with GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, or IL-12 and in naive, non-cytokine-primed cultures were similar, while much more TNF-alpha was induced in cytokine-primed naive cells. The effect of IL-12 was dependent on the presence of nonmonocytic cells and could be completely blocked with an IFN-gamma antiserum. Treatment of LPS-desensitized pure monocytes with IFN-gamma or GM-CSF resulted in a very high TNF-alpha expression and no difference to cytokine-primed naive monocytes was evident any longer. While IFN-gamma and IL-12 decreased IL-10 expression in naive PBMC, it was increased by both and by GM-CSF in LPS-tolerant cultures. Again, only IL-12 was dependent on the presence of nonmonocytic cells. For prevention of LPS tolerance, similar results were obtained. Recently, we have shown that IL-10 and TGF-beta mediate LPS desensitization in vitro and can be used to establish LPS hyporesponsiveness in the absence of LPS. IFN-gamma and GM-CSF prevented and reversed down-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-10 synthesis also in the model of IL-10/TGF-beta1-induced LPS hyporesponsiveness, while IL-12 was ineffective because of its obvious inability to induce IFN-gamma. In summary, after LPS desensitization/hyporesponsiveness, IFN-gamma and GM-CSF tended to normalize pro- and anti-inflammatory monocytic behavior. Our results suggest that during LPS desensitization/hyporesponsiveness, monocytes acquire a hitherto unknown functional state with an altered reaction to biologic response modifiers.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and IFN-gamma restore the systemic TNF-alpha response to endotoxin in lipopolysaccharide-desensitized mice.	The influence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IFN-gamma on the restoration of impaired TNF-alpha release in LPS-desensitized mice or their refractory macrophages was investigated. Mice pretreated with GM-CSF or IFN-gamma (50 microg/kg i.v.) and injected with 3 mg/kg LPS i.p. displayed increased plasma TNF-alpha levels compared with LPS controls. IL-10 was marginally up-regulated by GM-CSF but abrogated by IFN-gamma pretreatment. LPS-tolerant mice (30 microg/kg LPS i.p., -24 h) showed an attenuated plasma TNF-alpha and IL-10 response to LPS and survived LPS shock. Pretreatment of such mice with GM-CSF or IFN-gamma restored the previously impaired TNF-alpha response. In cultures of murine monocyte/macrophage-containing cell populations, i.e., alveolar, peritoneal, spleen, bone marrow cells, or blood, the presence of GM-CSF or IFN-gamma (10 ng/ml) resulted in an enhanced release of TNF-alpha initiated by 1 microg/ml LPS. Cells from LPS-tolerant mice showed a diminished responsiveness to LPS. However, when exposed to GM-CSF or IFN-gamma ex vivo, their TNF-alpha response to LPS was partially restored. These findings characterize GM-CSF and IFN-gamma as potent enhancers of LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in normal as well as in experimentally immunocompromised mice and provide the rationale for further experiments to explore the pharmacologic use of these cytokines for restoration of immunocompetence in sepsis-associated immunosuppression.

Does laparoscopy increase bacteremia and endotoxemia in a peritonitis model?	"Laparoscopy is increasingly used in patients with intraabdominal bacterial infection although pneumoperitoneum may increase bacteremia by elevated intraabdominal pressure.
The influence of laparotomy and laparoscopy on bacteremia, endotoxemia, and postoperative abscess formation was investigated in a rat model. Rats received intraperitoneally a standardized fecal inoculum and underwent laparotomy (n = 20), or laparoscopy (n = 20), or no further manipulation in the control group (n = 20).
Bacteremia and endotoxemia were higher after laparotomy and laparoscopy compared to the control group (p = 0.01) 1 h after intervention. One hour after intervention, aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were detected in the laparotomy group while only anaerobic bacteria were found in the other two groups. Although bacteremia and endotoxemia did not differ among the three groups after 1 week, the mean number of intraperitoneal abscesses was significantly higher (p < 0.05) after laparotomy (n = 10) compared with laparoscopy (n = 6) and control group (n = 5).
Laparoscopy does not increase bacteremia and intraperitoneal abscess formation compared to laparotomy in an animal model of peritonitis."

Tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis during the poisoning of mice with hepatotoxins.	"Treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces murine hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo when sensitizing concentrations of toxins are present. The aim of this study was to investigate whether endogenously formed TNF contributes to liver failure caused by hepatotoxins.
The extent of liver damage, induced by alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D (ActD), was examined under various experimental conditions, preventing the action of TNF on hepatocytes.
TNF induced apoptosis of murine hepatocytes or human hepatoma cells in the presence of alpha-amanitin or ActD. TNF and alpha-amanitin induced such hepatotoxicity also in vivo in a synergistic way. After in vivo administration of high doses of ActD or alpha-amanitin alone, hepatic TNF-messenger RNA was increased and hepatocytes underwent apoptosis. A neutralizing antiserum against TNF-alpha prevented the liver injury. Hepatotoxicity of ActD or alpha-amanitin also was prevented by pretreatment of mice with low doses of the tolerizing cytokine interleukin 1. Mice deficient for the 55-kilodalton TNF receptor were protected from ActD- or alpha-amanitin-induced toxicity. Endotoxin-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mice also had liver failure after ActD treatment, and this damage was prevented by treatment with anti-TNF antiserum.
Hepatotoxins such as alpha-amanitin may induce liver failure by an indirect mechanism involving sensitization of parenchymal cells toward endogenously produced TNF."

Interferon gamma-1b in the treatment of compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome. A new approach: proof of principle.	"Immunoparalysis is defined as a decrease in the level of HLA-DR expression on monocytes during the course of sepsis.
To evaluate whether interferon gamma-1b has an immunoregulatory effect in patients with immunoparalysis during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome.
Of the patients admitted consecutively to the intensive care unit for the management of sepsis, 10 received interferon gamma-1b, 100 micrograms per 0.5 mL, after confirmation of HLA-DR expression of less than 30% on 2 consecutive days. The therapy was continued until HLA-DR expression remained more than 50% for 3 days.
Interferon gamma-1b therapy resulted in the recovery of diminished levels of HLA-DR expression on monocytes. Of the 10 patients, 8 responded to treatment within 1 day. On the first day of interferon gamma-1b therapy, HLA-DR expression increased from mean (+/- SEM) pretreatment levels of 27% +/- 6% to 62% +/- 8% (P < .01) and remained high during the 28-day study period in 8 patients. The therapy was given to 2 patients a second time when HLA-DR expression on monocytes was less than 30%. The recovery of monocytic HLA-DR expression levels after administration of interferon gamma-1b was associated with restitution of monocytic function, reflected by a significant increase of plasma interleukin-6 (P < .05) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (P < .05) levels in 9 patients.
This study shows that HLA-DR expression is a good marker of compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome. It also shows that interferon gamma-1b not only restored the levels of HLA-DR expression but also reestablished the ability of monocytes to secrete the cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha."

"Type 2 helper T cell-type cytokines and the development of ""infectious"" tolerance in rat cardiac allograft recipients."	CD4-targeted therapy with a nondepleting RIB-5/2 mAb abrogates accelerated (< 36 h) rejection in presensitized LEW rats and results in permanent acceptance of LBNF1 cardiac allografts in conjunction with the features of infectious tolerance. This study examined the role and functional significance of the Th1 and Th2 cytokine network and systemic host allospecific Ab (allo-Ab) responses in the development of the infectious tolerance pathway in this model. Long term survival of cardiac transplants in rats treated with the tolerizing RIB-5/2 mAb regimen was accompanied by profound depression of Th1 (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines at the graft site, as shown by competitive template reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. In contrast, the expression of Th2-type cytokines was selectively up-regulated after transfer of infectious tolerance by spleen cells into new generations of primary and secondary test recipients. Donor-specific circulating IgM allo-Ab responses were diminished throughout, and the switch from IgM to IgG allo-Ab was completely prevented in tolerant hosts, as shown by flow cytometry. The demonstration that treatment with cytolytic anti-CD4, but not anti-CD8, mAb recreated rejection of test cardiac allografts with simultaneous down-regulation of IL-4 mRNA/protein expression underlines the importance of this cytokine in the development of infectious tolerance. Hence, this report documents distinct cytokine elaboration patterns in animals tolerized by CD4-targeted therapy compared with those rendered tolerant by putative regulatory Th2-like cells. The mechanism of tolerance in anti-CD4 mAb-treated hosts appears distinct from that operating in the absence of mAb, when the tolerant state is being transferred in an infectious manner to new cohorts of test recipients.

Humoral rejection after heart transplantation: reliability of intramyocardial electrogram recordings (IMEG) and myocardial biopsy.	"In recent years, as the importance of humoral-mediated rejection has increasingly become recognized, the fact that endomyocardial biopsies (BX) evaluated according to the criteria of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation often produce false-negative results has become a matter of concern. To evaluate the reliability of measuring intramyocardial ECG amplitude (IMEG) and immunofluorescence evaluation (FITC-labeled anti-IgG/ IgM staining) of endomyocardial biopsies (IFM), heterotopic neck-heart transplantation (HTX) was performed on eight beagles previously sensitized through skin transplantations. After HTX, IMEG, echo, and donor-specific antibodies in serum (IgG, IgM) were determined daily and myocardial biopsies (IFM, BX) were performed once every 2 days. Accelerated (humoral) rejection occurred on the 5th (4th-5th) postoperative day and sensitivity of IMEG, IFM, and BX was 100%, 75%, and 12.5%, respectively. In each case rejection was recognized so early that it was possible to initiate therapy with ""restitutio ad integrum"". Our results show that, as opposed to endomyocardial biopsy (IFM, BX), IMEG diagnosis detected humoral-mediated rejection early and with high reliability."

[Peritoneal instillation of taurolidine and heparin for preventing intraperitoneal tumor growth and trocar metastases in laparoscopic operations in the rat model].	"Although port-site metastases occur after laparoscopic surgery, there is no generally accepted approach to prevent tumor implantation so far.
In order to prevent tumor metastases, the effect of taurolidine and heparin on the growth of colon adenocarcinoma DHD/K12/TRb was measured in vitro and in a rat model. After incubation of the cells with heparin, taurolidine or both substances, the cell kinetics were determined. In a second experiment, tumor cells were administered intraperitoneally in rats (n = 60) and pneumoperitoneum was established over 30 min. Rats were randomized into four groups (I: tumor cells; II: cells + heparin; III: cells + taurolidine; IV: cells + taurolidine + heparin).
While tumor cell growth was not influenced by heparin in vitro, growth decreased significantly after incubation with taurolidine and taurolidine/heparin. In vivo, intraperitoneal tumor weight was lower in rats receiving heparin (298 +/- 155 mg) and taurolidine (149 +/- 247 mg) than in the control group (596 +/- 278 mg). When the two substance were combined, tumor growth was even less (21.5 +/- 36 mg). Trocar metastases were only lower in rats receiving taurolidine or the combination of taurolidine and heparin.
In vivo, heparin inhibits intraperitoneal tumor growth only slightly, while taurolidine causes a significant decrease in tumor cell growth in vitro as well as intraperitoneal tumor growth and trocar metastases in vivo."

Different release of cytokines into the cerebrospinal fluid following surgery for intra- and extra-axial brain tumours.	To elucidate the role of cytokines in brain repair processes and in local inflammation after neurosurgical procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 8 patients with intra-axial tumours and 8 patients with extra-axial tumours were analysed for interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha at the beginning and after surgery. Levels of IL-6 and IL-8 increased dramatically in all patients just hours after surgery and fell during subsequent days. IL-1 beta was found only in low amounts in the CSF of both patient groups. Other cytokines demonstrated different courses. In patients with intra-axial tumours IL-1 ra peaked two to four hours after surgery with a subsequent decrease. In patients with extra-axial tumours there was a continuous low-level IL-1 ra release into the CSF without a peak. TNF-alpha was not present in detectable levels in the CSF after surgery for extra-axial tumours but was found to peak two to four hours after surgery for intra-axial tumours. IL-10 was detected in the CSF of both patient groups, but a higher peak was seen after surgery for extra-axial tumours. These results suggest different requirements for the cytokine response and an involvement of different cell types in cytokine release. However, the analysis of the CSF from both patient groups showed no differences in cell counts and populations, with a mild pleocytosis being present in both patient groups after surgery. Therefore, we conclude that after surgery for extra-axial tumours cytokines were predominately produced by non-immune cells stimulated through hypoxia or mechanical irritation. After surgery for intra-axial tumours with a significant brain injury immune cells-activated by necrotic material-seen to be involved in the process of cytokine synthesis. In these cases an additional IL-1ra and TNF-alpha peak was found and these cytokines may be markers for cerebral injury.

Tumor growth was evaluated in three experiments: (1) in vitro (n = 60), (2) ex vivo (n = 60), and (3) in vivo (n = 60). After insufflation, cell kinetics were determined in the first two experiments. In the third experiment, tumor growth was measured subcutaneously and intraperitoneally 5 weeks after insufflation.
Tumor cell growth increased significantly after insufflation with carbon dioxide in vitro (p < 0.03) and ex vivo (p < 0.05) compared with the control group, whereas helium did not stimulate cell growth. In vivo, subcutaneous tumor growth was promoted by carbon dioxide (131 +/- 55 mg) (p < 0.01) compared with helium (35 +/- 34 mg) and the control group (36 +/- 33 mg). Total intraperitoneal tumor weight was 717 +/- 320 mg in carbon dioxide group compared with helium (549 +/- 231 mg) and control group (570 +/- 321 mg).
The insufflation of carbon dioxide promotes tumor growth compared with helium and control in a rat model. Further studies should confirm these results before alternative gases should be recommended in laparoscopic surgery for malignant diseases."

IL-7 mRNA is not overexpressed in mycosis fungoides and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma and is likely to be an autocrine growth factor in vivo.	Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is thought to be a growth factor for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) since it has been shown that IL-7 transgenic mice develop a cutaneous disorder characterized by enhanced T-cell proliferation with progression to malignancy and that in vitro growth of Sézary cell lines is IL-7 dependent. However, no direct in vivo evidence exists for the involvement of IL-7 in the pathogenesis of CTCL. Therefore, we examined IL-7 mRNA expression in skin biopsies from patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) (n = 20) and pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma (n = 5). By semiquantitative RT-PCR, IL-7 mRNA was not detectable in any of the CTCL samples, or in normal human skin (n = 8) or in skin from patients with psoriasis (n = 7) or atopic dermatitis (n = 5). In contrast, IL-7 mRNA was detected in a biopsy from a kidney allograft transplant, in normal keratinocytes under various culture conditions and in several cell lines. Interestingly, using a highly sensitive nested PCR, IL-7 mRNA was detectable in all specimens tested, but there was no indication of IL-7 overexpression in MF then analysing lesions of patch, plaque or tumour stages. In contrast, increasing CD3 expression was found, which was most likely a consequence of the enhanced density of malignant T cells in advanced tumour stages. In summary, by the use of semiquantitative RT-PCR we were not able to detect IL-7 overexpression in MF or pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma. This indicates that IL-7 is probably not an autocrine growth factor in these CTCLs.

Nondepleting anti-CD4 antibody treatment prolongs lung-directed E1-deleted adenovirus-mediated gene expression in rats.	E1-deleted adenoviral vectors are efficient vectors for somatic cell gene therapy, but transgene expression is limited in part by a cytotoxic T cell response directed against virally transduced cells. Moreover, the development of a neutralizing antibody response limits secondary gene transfer with these vectors. Therapy with a depleting anti-CD4 antibody permits prolonged transgene expression in the lung and liver of mice. Furthermore, transient depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes blocks neutralizing antibody production and therefore allows repeat administration and expression of E1-deleted recombinant adenovirus. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a novel nondepleting anti-CD4 antibody (RIB 5/2) in a model of lung-directed gene therapy in outbred rats. Treatment with RIB 5/2 permitted prolonged reporter gene expression and reduced adenovirus-induced peribronchial and alveolar inflammation in the lung. Moreover administration of RIB 5/2 blocked the development of an anti-adenoviral neutralizing antibody response in the lung and permitted secondary administration and expression of a recombinant adenovirus. These data support the role of immunomodulation in prolonging in vivo transgene expression by recombinant adenovirus.

Progression of mycosis fungoides is associated with increasing cutaneous expression of interleukin-10 mRNA.	Cytokines are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Data regarding the local cytokine pattern in mycosis fungoides (MF) are partly conflicting. Recent studies have suggested a shift from type 1 to type 2 cytokine pattern because IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA have been more frequently detected in lesions of advanced stages. Another study has described a type 1 cytokine pattern in MF lesions. None of the previous studies of cytokine mRNA expression in MF, however, used quantitative methods, and therefore only the presence of a cytokine, but not the level of expression, could be determined. To gain better insight into the development of cytokine pattern during tumor progression we used semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to analyze cytokine mRNA expression in MF skin lesions at different stages. Biopsies from patients with patch (n = 11), plaque (n = 6), and tumor (n = 3) stage MF were compared with biopsies from patients with pleomorphic T cell lymphoma (n = 5), psoriasis (n = 7), atopic dermatitis (n = 5), and nonlesional skin (n = 8). MF progression was associated with significantly higher IL-10 and lower interferon-gamma mRNA expression. Moreover, the stage-dependent increase in IL-10 mRNA expression was also found in paired samples from individual patients. Unlike in pleomorphic T cell lymphoma, however, typical T helper 2 cells did not seem to be the source of increasing IL-10 in advanced MF, because stage-independent IL-4 mRNA was rarely detected, suggesting contribution of nonlymphoid cells to local IL-10 production. The overexpression of IL-10 in MF may be of importance for tumor progression, because this immunosuppressive cytokine might be involved in downregulation of immunologic tumor surveillance.

T cell stimulus-induced crosstalk between lymphocytes and liver macrophages results in augmented cytokine release.	Polyclonal T cell stimulation in humans leads to a cytokine burst syndrome that may result in organ failure or lethality. Mechanisms of such cytokine-dependent morbidity can be studied in mice challenged with the T cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A). In this model tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-dependent toxicity is characterized by a relatively selective liver failure. We examined here whether a crosstalk between liver macrophages and lymphocytes may be the underlying cause for the overshooting TNF response. Lymphocytes from lymph nodes, thymus, or the spleen were cocultured with Kupffer cells and stimulated with the polyclonal T cell stimuli Con A, anti-CD3 mAb, or staphylococcal enterotoxin B. We observed a rapid and synergistically augmented release of TNF, and also of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IFN-gamma, compared to stimulation of the individual cell types alone. This dramatically upregulated cytokine response did not require direct cell contact, but was mediated by a soluble factor. In order to find out whether TNF upregulation would require additional cell types in the liver, we used cocultures of T cells and a macrophage cell line and confirmed our previous results. In this model system an increase in TNF mRNA was observed in macrophages, but not in T cells. We conclude that the T cell-macrophage crosstalk following polyclonal T cell stimulation may be responsible for an overshooting TNF release from macrophages. This mechanism finally may lead to organ damage such as liver injury upon Con A injection into mice.

[Inflammatory mediators in patients with biventricular assist device systems].	"We studied the plasma levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and soluble adhesion molecules (sE-Selectin, sL-Selectin, sVCAM-1) immediately before and during mechanical circulatory support with a Biventricular Assist Device System (BVAD-""Berlin Heart"") in comparison to patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA classes II/III) and patients with coronary artery disease with normal ventricular function. Additionally, the biocompatibility of the membranes used in the ""Berlin Heart"" was tested in vitro. IL-6 and IL-8 but not TNF-alpha could only be detected in patients with cardiogenic shock immediately before starting circulatory support. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of soluble adhesion molecules were statistically significantly elevated in patients with cardiogenic shock compared to patients with coronary artery disease. This picture of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome without significant level of TNF-alpha looks quite similar to that seen in patients following trauma and severe operations. During mechanical circulatory support plasma levels of cytokines and soluble adhesion molecules dropped to low levels in patients, who were successfully maintained on BVAD. By contrast, we have found persistently elevated levels of these mediators in patients with fatal outcome. This seems not to be the result of individual distinct response of blood cells to contact with the artificial surfaces of the device. In summary, our data suggest the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome may be due to hypoxia during cardiogenic shock. Persistence of systemic inflammation suggests failing of the mechanical support. Therefore, the monitoring of inflammatory mediators may be relevant as a prognostic marker in these patients (disappearance of peripheral hypoxia)."

Peripheral T cell activation in long-term renal transplant patients: concordant upregulation of adhesion molecules and cytokine gene transcription.	In renal transplant, patients, the number of T cells expressing high levels of LFA-1 (LFA-1-bright) and of T cells expressing CD57 increases in response to viral infection, even if the latter is asymptomatic. Their role in long-term renal transplant patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia and concomitant transplant dysfunction was investigated. For this purpose, this study used triple-color flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting of peripheral blood T cells (CD3+/LFA-1-dim or -bright and CD8+/CD57+ or CD57- subsets), and subsequent semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cytokine mRNA levels for interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon-gamma, as well as Granzyme A and IL-2R p55 and p75 transcripts were determined and compared in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in separated T cell subsets. Although in patients with CMV infection and/or rejection, cytokine transcripts were readily detected and the levels in the CD3+/LFA-1-bright subsets were, by orders of magnitudes, higher than in the LFA-1-dim subset, hardly any cytokine message was found in patients without CMV infection or rejection episodes or in control subjects. The expression of Granzyme A, which is involved in cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity, was not upregulated in LFA-1-bright T cells, which is in discordance with cytokine levels. Differences between CD57+ and CD57- T cells were limited to the IL-2R p55 mRNA, of which the former expressed significantly less than the latter. It is concluded that upon virus-induced activation of peripheral blood T cells, an effector type that is marked by high inflammatory but small cytotoxic potential is produced. The results of this study propose that these cells represent a correlate of persistent immune activation and are liable to produce graft dysfunction, although they are unable to clear the organism from virus infection because of their lack of cytotoxic potential.

Clinical pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in rescue therapy after renal transplantation.	Tacrolimus, a potent new immunosuppressive drug, was introduced for rescue therapy in 25 renal transplant recipients with ongoing rejection (n = 24) or severe cyclosporine toxicity (n = 1). A highly significant (p < 0.001) rise in serum creatinine from 138 +/- 14 (3 months before conversion) to 295 +/- 26 mumol/l preceded conversion to tacrolimus. Tacrolimus rescue therapy started 73 +/- 9 months after transplantation, the follow-up was 8 +/- 1 months. Outcome, pharmacokinetics, and side-effects were analyzed. Patient survival was 100% on tacrolimus therapy. Graft survival was 88% after 3 months, and 70% after 8 months. Serum creatinine remained stable during the observation period (Crea after 8 months: 271 +/- 26 mumol/l). Starting with an initial dose of 9.6 +/- 0.3 mg/day (0.14 +/- 0.01 mg/kg/day) we could reduce tacrolimus dose to 6.0 +/- 0.9 mg/day (0.09 +/- 0.02 mg/kg/day; p < 0.001) after 1 month. Tacrolimus trough levels were adjusted to a therapeutic window of 5-8 ng/ml. We had to perform 3.4 +/- 0.5 dose adjustments per patient mainly within the first month after conversion (70%). A high variability in interindividual tacrolimus dose was noted. Last cyclosporine dose was a good predictor of required tacrolimus dose after 1 month (r = 0.88; p < 0.001). Overall, 82 adverse events were noted, of which 29 (35%) were associated with high trough levels (> 10 ng/ml). In contrast, 3 patients with trough levels < 4 ng/ml had ongoing rejection. Blood pressure and routine laboratory data remained unchanged. Steroid dose could be tapered from 12 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 0.3 mg/day (p < 0.02). Gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism improved after conversion. We conclude: Tacrolimus conversion for rescue therapy after renal transplantation is efficient and safe with target trough levels between 5 -8 ng/ml. Frequent drug monitoring is necessary, especially within the first month after conversion. Previous cyclosporine dose can be used as a guideline for starting dose.

Neutralizing murine monoclonal anti-interleukin-10 antibodies enhance binding of antibodies against a different epitope.	Fifteen murine hybridoma lines that produce monoclonal antibodies against human interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is one of the most important regulatory cytokines of the immune system, were raised. Twelve of these antibodies, all in the class IgG1/kappa, recognize three groups of epitopes: A, B and C. All antibodies in these groups inhibit binding of antibodies of the same group to IL-10 and none of them inhibit binding of an antibody of another group. Two IgM/kappa antibodies and one IgG1/kappa antibody, with low affinity, have distinct binding properties and cannot be assigned to one of these groups. Antibodies from all three epitope groups inhibit the biological activity of IL-10. The three antibodies of group A neutralize IL-10 in an approximately equimolar ratio, at concentrations as low as 10 pM. In addition to their high neutralizing capacity, antibodies of group A enhance the binding of antibodies of group C to IL-10. The on-rate of binding of the two antibodies CB/RS/10 and 11 (group C) increased five- to seven-fold, when one of the antibodies CB/RS/1, 2 or 14 (group A) is bound to IL-10.

[Intramyocardial electrocardiogram (IMEG) in diagnosis of humoral rejection after heart transplantation].	Measuring intramyocardial ECG amplitude is a clinical non-invasive procedure used for diagnosing rejection after heart transplantation. In recent years, as the importance of humoral mediated rejection has increasingly been recognized, the fact that endomyocardial biopsies often produce false negative results due to the absence of lymphocytic infiltrates has become a matter of concern. In order to test the reliability of IMEG diagnosis of this form of rejection, heterotopic neck-heart transplantation was performed on eight beagles which were previously sensitized through several skin transplantations. Over the course of the study IMEG registrations were performed daily as well as echocardiographic examinations to determine left ventricular wall thickness and maximal diastolic relaxation velocity. Donor-specific antibodies in serum (IgG, IgM) were also determined daily. Myocardial biopsies, performed once every 2 days, were examined for the presence of edema and lymphocytic infiltrate (according to the guidelines of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation, ISHLT) and examined under immunofluorescent microscopy of IgG and IgM. Under triple drug immunosuppression with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and cortisone accelerated rejection occurred on the fifth postoperative day (range: 4th-5th). All eight episodes were detected through IMEG diagnosis (sensitivity 100%), while the myocardial biopsies graded according to ISHLT guidelines indicated only one case of relevant lymphocytic infiltrate (Grade 3A) (sensitivity 12.5%). In each case rejection was recognized so early that it was possible to perform therapy with restitutio ad integrum. This proved that, as opposed to endomyocardial biopsy, IMEG diagnosis detected humoral mediated rejection early and with high reliability. Furthermore, the immediate recovery in IMEG during therapy indicates that the voltage decrease cause by rejection cannot be explained by an irreversible loss of myocardium (myocytolysis), but rather may be due to a quickly reversible functional impairment.

Blood contact with artificial surfaces during BVAD support.	Persistently elevated levels of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) during the course of mechanical circulatory support correlated well with fatal outcome. To determine the influence of blood/artificial surface interaction on the chronic inflammatory process, we studied the biocompatibility of silicone and polyurethane membranes in vitro. Cultures of isolated mononuclear cells or whole blood were incubated for 24 hours in tubes coated with silicone or polyurethane, both used in the construction of ventricular assist systems. Concentrations of several inflammatory mediators were measured in the supernatant. Our results can be summarized as follows: a) Monocytes were stimulated to release inflammatory cytokines like IL-8 and MIP-1 alpha, particularly when silicone was involved; b) Both silicone and polyurethane stimulated thrombocytes thus resulting in the release of P-Selectin and PDGF-AB, although polyurethane was a stronger stimulus; c) Moderate complement activation was triggered by contact with either of the artificial surfaces. However, the prevention of most of these effects by coating the artificial surface with protein and the lack of correlation between in vitro data and serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 during the course of circulatory support suggest that the persistence of inflammatory cytokines during BVAD support is not caused by blood/surface interaction.

Malignant tumours after renal transplantation.	In 1243 patients after renal transplantation, 39 malignant tumours were detected in 37 patients. The average latency period between transplantation and tumour disease was 72 months. Tumours included 8 malignant lymphomas, 7 dermatomas and 24 visceral tumours. The patients who developed a tumour had received fewer blood transfusions before transplantation than a tumour-free control group of 60 patients with renal transplants. Rejection crises occurred in a significantly smaller number of tumour patients compared with the control group.

Monocyte deactivation--rationale for a new therapeutic strategy in sepsis.	"Inflammatory cells, in particular monocytes/macrophages, release pro-inflammatory mediators in response to several infectious and non-infectious stimuli. The excessive release of these mediators, resulting in the development of whole body inflammation, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. TNF-alpha, acting synergistically with cytokines such as IL-1, GM-CSF and IFN-gamma, is the key mediator in the induction process of septic shock, as shown in several experimental models. Based on this concept and on the encouraging results obtained in several experimental models, a number of clinical sepsis trials targeting the production or action of TNF-alpha or IL-1 have been performed in recent years. Unfortunately, these trials have failed to demonstrate a therapeutic benefit. One reason for this may be the lack of exact immunologic analyses during the course of septic disease. Recently, we demonstrated that there is a biphasic immunologic response in sepsis: an initial hyperinflammatory phase is followed by a hypo-inflammatory one. The latter is associated with immunodeficiency which is characterized by monocytic deactivation, which we have called ""immunoparalysis"". While anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g. anti-TNF antibodies, IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10) makes sense during the initial hyperinflammatory phase, immune stimulation by removing inhibitory factors (plasmapheresis) or the administration of monocyte activating cytokines (IFN-gamma, GM-CSF) may be more useful during ""immunoparalysis""."

Accumulation and persistence of hepatitis B virus core gene deletion mutants in renal transplant patients are associated with end-stage liver disease.	In renal transplant recipients, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection often leads to cirrhosis and liver failure. In this study, we investigated whether or not in these patients viral variants would emerge despite immunosuppression, and whether they are associated with a specific course of liver disease. In a population of 552 renal transplant recipients hepatitis B 24 surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients were available for a 2-year follow-up. By polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, HBV genomes with deletions in the middle of the core gene (C-gene) were found in 9 out of the 24 patients. Seven of the 9 patients (group I) showed either persistent or increasing amounts of these variants; all patients had cirrhosis, and 5 died of end-stage liver disease. The viral variants emerged at least 1 year before liver failure. In 2 out of the 9 patients, the core deletion variants disappeared, and no further deterioration of the liver function was observed thereafter. In the remaining 15 patients (group II) without deletion mutants detected at any time, only 3 had cirrhosis (P < .001, group I vs. II), and none died (P < .001). Between both groups, there were no statistically significant differences in the other relevant variables that were examined. These results indicate that HBV C-gene deletion mutants can accumulate in long-term immunosuppressed patients, and that their persistence is associated with progressive liver disease. The accumulation of these variants may be caused by the development of cirrhosis or could be involved in hepatopathogenesis.

"Induction of ""infectious"" tolerance to MHC-incompatible cardiac allografts in CD4 monoclonal antibody-treated sensitized rat recipients."	"LBNF1 heart grafts are rejected in an accelerated manner within 36 h by LEW rats that have been sensitized with Brown Norway rat skin grafts on day -7. Treatment with RIB-5/2, a CD4-nondepleting mAb (10 doses of 5 mg/rat/day, i.v., from day -7 to day +21) abrogated rejection at <36 h and produced indefinite (>200 days) cardiac allograft survival. Transplantation tolerance in this model developed within several weeks, and during the maintenance phase (>100 days) it was associated with diminished host circulating allo-Ab responses and induction of peripheral allospecific T cell unresponsiveness both in vitro and in vivo. Tolerant cells in mAb-treated hosts could disable naive or alloimmune cells, so that they failed to trigger graft rejection. Moreover, donor-specific and organ-nonspecific tolerance could be adoptively transferred by spleen cells alone into new sets of primary (100%) and secondary (>40%) test recipients. CD4+ T cells were instrumental for the induction of such readily transferable tolerance. The first and second generation suppressive regulatory cells were also critical for the inhibition of allograft recognition by normal or even alloimmune cells. Hence, the features of an ""infectious"" tolerance pathway to minor histocompatibility-mismatched skin grafts, originally described in thymectomized mice, may be applied to the euthymic primed rats rendered tolerant to fully MHC-incompatible vascularized organ allografts. Such reprogramming of host cell-mediated regulatory mechanisms following CD4-targeted therapy adds to our appreciation of the potential utility and applicability of infectious tolerance in transplant recipients treated with a perioperative course of CD4-targeted monotherapy."

Differential regulation of monocytic tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-10 expression.	Activation of human monocytes by bacterial endotoxin (LPS) results in an initial burst of inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha which is followed by the secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators like interleukin (IL)-10. The signaling pathways in IL-10 induction are unknown. Here, we show that the regulation of IL-10 expression is more complex than that of TNF-alpha. LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-10 expression requires early activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK). Moreover, delayed addition of PTK inhibitors blocked IL-10, but not TNF-alpha, suggesting the impact of a late PTK activity. Two inducers of PTK activity are the downstream mediators of LPS activation, TNF-alpha and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Both mediators synergistically up-regulate IL-10 expression. Downstream of PTK activation, they use distinct pathways. TNF-alpha, but not cAMP-induced IL-10 gene expression was inhibited by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, suggesting the involvement of reactive oxygen species. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) suppressed LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-10 expression as well, but, unlike TNF-alpha, direct activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) did not induce IL-10 expression. Furthermore, PKC is not involved in late events of IL-10 activation, as delayed addition of PKC inhibitors did not suppress LPS-induced IL-10 expression and did not influence cAMP- or TNF-alpha-induced IL-10. The modulation of IL-10 expression by inflammatory mediators suggests a regulatory circuit of the inflammatory response.

Enhanced release of interleukin-10 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors as novel principles of methylxanthine action in murine models of endotoxic shock.	The immunomodulating capacity of the methylxanthine A802715 (5-hydroxy-5-methyl)hexyl-3-methyl-7-propylxanthin) was investigated in various murine models of endotoxemia and compared with that of the chemically related reference compound pentoxifylline. At a dose of 180 mg/kg both compounds protected mice against a lethal shock dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (5 mg/kg) in nonsensitized mice and against LPS (5 micrograms/kg)-initiated liver failure in D-galactosamine (700 mg/kg)-sensitized animals. The methylxanthines attenuated systemic release of endogenous tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma during endotoxic shock, and potently up-regulated early production of circulating interleukin-10 and interleukin-6. Treatment of mice with A802715 alone induced levels of circulating soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R p55 and p75) 3- to 4-fold higher than those of controls. This increase was additive to the one elicited by LPS. Moreover, pentoxifylline and A802715 prevented liver injury due to intravenous injection of recombinant TNF in D-galactosamine-sensitized mice. In primary cultures of murine hepatocytes, A802715 (500 microM) as well as other cAMP-raising compounds conferred protection from TNF cytotoxicity. We concluded that, in addition to a direct target cell protection via an increase in intracellular cAMP, methylxanthines prevented the systemic toxicity of LPS in mice by a further principle, i.e., by a shift of the humoral response to LPS in favor of an enhanced release of immunosuppressive cytokines.

Mapping protein-protein contact sites using cellulose-bound peptide scans.	We have characterized the interaction of two monoclonal antibodies with their respective antigens using cellulose-bound sets of overlapping peptides (peptide scans). Both antibodies CB/RS/5 and CB/MT/1 recognize discontinuous epitopes present in human interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, the interaction between TNF-alpha and its 55-kDa receptor (TNF-R) was investigated by the same approach. Both antibodies, as well as TNF-alpha, interacted with two or more regions of the peptide scans. Antibody-binding competition studies between the native antigens and peptides, covering single parts of the binding regions, enabled us to distinguish between binding to the paratope or other regions of the antibody. The combination of these experimental approaches allowed the identification of short antigen-derived sequences that are separated on the primary sequence but close in space on the surface of IL-10 and TNF-alpha, thus representing putative discontinuous epitopes. In the case of the TNF-R-derived peptide scans, two of the identified regions interact with the structurally similar TNF-beta in the TNF-beta-TNF-R complex. These data indicate that this approach should be generally applicable for mapping nonlinear protein-protein contact sites.

Removal of autoantibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy by immunoadsorption.	Immunoadsorption with Ig-Therasorb leads to a marked decrease in serum levels of immunoglobulins including of the agonist-like anti-beta 1-adrenoceptor autoantibody found in the serum of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The reduction in autoantibody levels was accompanied by an improvement of heart function and a shift to a lower NYHA state. In this disease, as in a variety of other autoimmune disorders, apheresis with Ig-Therasorb led to a rapid improvement of the clinical status and could be used in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (with autoantibodies) as a bridge for transplantation.

Assessment of chronic rejection in permanent accepted renal allografts in anti-CD4 treated rats.	In rats, transient prophylactic anti-CD4 therapy with the nondepleting mAB RIB5/2 prevents acute rejection of MHC-mismatched allografted kidneys and induces long-lasting unresponsiveness. However, little is known about long-term benefits of this prophylactic anti-CD4 regimen. Here we report experimental results of permanently accepted rat renal allografts after prophylactic anti-CD4 treatment in regard to signs of chronic rejection. Kidneys from Wistar Furth donors were orthotopically grafted into bilateral nephrectomized BDIX recipients under the cover of anti-CD4 treatment (20 mg/kg b.w). Kidney function was serially monitored by measurement of serum creatinine and urine protein excretion. After 100 or 300 days respectively renal allografts were harvested, histologically and immunohistologically assessed and intragraft cytokine gene expression determined. Serum creatinine increased in few allografted rats. 30% of the 300-day-old grafts had an increased proteinuria and higher degrees of glomerular sclerosis. In these grafts cellular infiltration was more pronounced. However, no activated leukocytes (IL-2 receptor positive) were detected. Correspondingly, intragraft gene expression of CD3, IL-10 and IFN gamma was low. The results of our study indicate that a prophylactic anti-CD4 regimen diminishes chronic rejection to a level comparable to isografted or naive mass-reduced or ischemic kidneys. Thus, the signs of chronic rejection observed seem to be mainly caused by alloantigen-independent processes.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity-like mechanisms dominate late acute rejection episodes in renal allograft recipients.	Episodes of acute rejection (aRx) may occur in functional renal allografts even at a very late stage post-Tx. Histopathology in early and late aRx looks quite similar--however, there is a slower deterioration of graft function in late aRx, suggesting that pathogenetic immune mechanisms are different. In order to investigate this phenomenon we studied the gene expression pattern (IL-1beta, 2, 4, 8, 10, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, GrnA, IL-2R p55/p75) in PBMC and core biopsies from long-term renal allograft recipients with histologically proven late aRx and compared it with transplant and non-transplant controls using a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. PBMC and graft-infiltrating cells of patients with late aRx showed an upregulation, especially of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and TNFalpha transcripts. While IL-2 mRNA was only detected in PBMC of two patients with late aRx who were not on cyclosporine, upregulation of intragraft IL-2 mRNA allowed the best discrimination between aRx and the other groups (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 93%). In contrast to several reports on early Rx we did not notice an elevation of granzyme A transcripts in comparison with the controls, suggesting that cell-mediated inflammatory processes (CD4+ T cell-mediated DTH) dominate the late aRx, while early aRx is characterized by the additional involvement of cytotoxic T cell response. This may explain the distinct clinical course. Additionally, in a pilot study we successfully treated late aRx in 10/12 patients with the anti-CD 4 mAb, 16H5. Our encouraging therapeutic results underline the pathogenetic role of CD4+ T cells and support our hypothesis on DTH-like mechanisms in late aRx.

The enigma of CD57+CD28- T cell expansion--anergy or activation?	Expansion of a CD57+CD8+ T lymphocyte subset has been reported in HIV and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Almost all of these T cells lack CD28 expression. While CD28- cells are often associated with anergy, some authors believe their expansion in HIV infection precipitates immunodeficiency. We studied 15 randomly chosen patients with immune activation and observed that CD57+CD28- T cell expansion may occur in various conditions and to the same degree as in HIV infection without resulting in immunodeficiency. Triple colour flow cytometry also revealed that the CD57 and CD28 antigens are coexpressed in only 3% of CD8+ T cells, irrespective of the underlying condition, so that almost all CD57+CD8+ cells are always CD28-. Analysis of Fas (CD95) expression with respect to CD28 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 10 additional patients indicated no increased commitment to apoptosis in CD28- T cells. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) comparing CD28+ and CD28-CD8+ T cells with respect to cytokine gene expression (tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-1beta) in five renal transplant patients with expansion of the CD57+ subset detected no cytokine gene expression deficit in CD28- T cells. A direct association of increased proportions of CD57+CD28-CD8+ T cells with immunodeficiency/anergy is disputed.

alpha/beta-T cell receptor-directed therapy in rat allograft recipients. Long-term survival of cardiac allografts after pretreatment with R73 mAb is associated with upregulation of Th2-type cytokines.	"Rejection of vascularized allografts still poses the major problem in organ transplantation. Therefore, transplant rejection of cardiac allografts was investigated in a rat model (BN-to-LEW) under alpha/beta-TCR (R73) mAb-targeted therapy. Two protocols were studied: posttransplant (""immunosuppressive"") and pretransplant conditioning therapy. In posttransplant therapy over a wide dose range, R73 mAb only marginally improved cardiac allograft survival (7.8 +/- 0.8 days vs. 12.5 +/- 0.8 days at 0.1 mg/kg for 7 days). In contrast, conditioning treatment with low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) anti-alpha/beta-TCR mAb given 3 to 7 days prior to organ transplantation was highly effective and resulted in 50% permanent acceptance of cardiac allografts. R73 mAb-treated rats were monitored with respect to peripheral lymphocyte populations and intragraft cytokine levels. A temporary, incomplete reduction (CD5+ cells) and partial modulation (alpha/beta-TCR/CD5 double+ cells) in the peripheral blood was observed. In contrast to untreated controls, intragraft production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma at the mRNA and protein level was abolished in both post- and pretreated recipients. Interestingly, pretransplant mAb application was associated with augmented in situ elaboration of the Th2-type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-10, together with up-regulated TGF-beta and PGE. Increased expression of IL-4 and IL-10 continued to be observed in long-term surviving allografts. In conclusion, the mechanism of conditioning therapy with alpha/beta-TCR mAb prior to alloantigen exposure appears to be a switch from Th1 to Th2 response allowing long-term acceptance of allogeneic grafts."

The effects of nondepleting CD4 targeted therapy in presensitized rat recipients of cardiac allografts.	The immunosuppressive effects of RIB-5/2, a nondepleting anti-rat CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb), were analyzed in a well-defined model of accelerated cardiac allograft rejection. (LEW x BN)F1 hearts are rejected within 24 hours in LEW hosts presensitized with BN skin grafts at day -7. Treatment with RIB-5/2 mAb (3.5 mg/day i.v.) at days -7 and -1, prolonged cardiac allograft survival to the median of >62 days. The long-term recipients rejected acutely third-party (Wistar-Furth) test skin grafts, without an adverse effect on the survival of the original cardiac transplants. Lymphocytes harvested from mAb-treated hosts significantly decreased proliferative responses of donor cells in mixed leukocyte reaction. The cell activation and cytokine elaboration patterns were evaluated at the mRNA and protein levels by competitive template reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Cardiac allografts in CD4 mAb-treated rats at 24 hours displayed reduced CD3, CD25, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and IL-10 mRNA levels as compared to those in rejecting grafts. Equal amounts of IL-4 mRNA were detected throughout in both animal groups; the expression of IL-10 mRNA increased progressively in the treated hosts. In contrast, IFN-gamma was consistently depressed after mAb therapy. The mRNA levels coding for CD3, CD25, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1-beta, and IL-2 genes were comparable in long-surviving and rejecting allografts. The staining for IL-2R, IL-2, and IFN-gamma was diminished, whereas the staining for IL-4 was either unaffected or enhanced in well-functioning grafts in RIB-5/2 mAb-treated hosts. The untreated recipients elicited strong circulating IgM allo-Ab response, which peaked around the time of cardiac rejection and then switched to IgG allo-Ab 4-7 days after heart transplantation. Treatment with RIB-5/2 mAb decreased IgM and prevented the switch into the IgG allo-Ab response. In conclusion, the ability of RIB-5/2 mAb treatment to combat accelerated rejection and to produce long-term graft acceptance is unprecedented in our experience in this model. These data provide new insights into the complexities of the cellular and humoral responsiveness, contributing to the the induction of donor-specific unresponsiveness in sensitized hosts. This study, along with our previous reports, indicate that an immune deviation in which intragraft Th1-type cytokines (primarily IFN-gamma) are diminished and Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) are maintained represents the common effector mechanism of CD4 mAb regimens in recipients of vascularized organ allografts.

Inactivation of the very strong HCMV immediate early promoter by DNA CpG methylation in vitro.	The influence of DNA methylation in vitro on the activity of the very strong human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate early (IE) modulator/enhancer/promoter region was investigated by transient transfection experiments of premonocytic HL-60 cells. While sequence-specific methylation of the major IE enhancer and/or modulator with the cytosine methyl-transferases FnuDII, HhaI and HaeIII had no significant effect, the promoter activity was completely repressed by methylation of the cytosine in 5'-CpG sites with the Spiroplasma methyltransferase SssI. Addition of TNF-alpha or PMA which are strong stimulators of HCMV major IE enhancer/promoter activity in premonocytic HL-60 cells had no effect on repression. Inactivation of the IE enhancer/promoter via methylation by M.SssI could be partially alleviated by co-transfection with an excess of untranscribable highly methylated DNA. These results indicate that a methyl-CpG binding factor is involved as mediator in the inhibitory effect of HCMV enhancer/promoter methylation. Taken together, the HCMV major IE enhancer/ promoter has been shown to be susceptible to transcriptional inactivation by methylation of the cytosines in CpG dinucleotides, a process that is proposed to play a modulatory role in viral latency.

Electric myocardial impedance registration in humoral rejection after heart transplantation.	"Because of the absent lymphocyte infiltrate, humoral-mediated rejection after heart transplantation is not diagnosed by the usual staining technique (hematoxylin-eosin method) of the endomyocardial biopsy specimen. However, humoral rejection is characterized by a distinct myocardial edema caused by capillary leakage. Because tissue edema increases the electric myocardial impedance of the corresponding tissue compartment the electric myocardial impedance method should be able to detect these episodes more reliably than biopsy.
To evaluate this hypothesis eight DLA-matched beagle dogs were subjected to heterotopic neck heart transplantation after multiple sensitization by skin grafts of the heart donor. For electric myocardial impedance registrations rectangular impulses (wide 1 msec) were applied over two intramyocardial electrodes and the impulse response was registered. Day-to-day comparisons were made and an increase of electric myocardial impedance of 10% or more was used as an indicator of rejection. To assess the influence of edema caused by electrode implantation, cortisone administration, narcosis, ischemia, or reperfusion on the electric myocardial impedance, identical electrodes were implanted in the native hearts of five additional dogs via lateral thoracotomy. These animals each received 100 mg methylprednisolone between postoperative days 20 and 22 and underwent heterotopic neck heart transplantation on postoperative day 28 without previous sensitization (protocol 2). Electric myocardial impedance electrodes were also implanted in these allografts (protocol 3). After transplantation myocardial biopsies were done every 2 days and the samples graded according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation classification in all dogs.
Despite triple-drug immunosuppression (cyclosporine A, prednisolone, azathioprine) humoral rejection developed in all sensitized dogs as established by immunofluorescent staining of myocardial biopsy samples and functional deterioration. All episodes were diagnosed by electric myocardial impedance (sensitivity 100%), whereas only in one case the biopsy specimen was positive (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation grade > 1) (sensitivity 12.5%). All eight episodes could be treated successfully, that is, myocardial performance and electric myocardial impedance showed an immediate and full recovery. During the first 12 days none of the nonsensitized dogs exhibited rejection. Protocol 2 indicated that narcosis and the administration of cortisone did not per se have an influence on electric myocardial impedance and the influence of electrode implantation was negligible. Contrarily, edema caused by ischemia and reperfusion during transplantation (protocols 1 and 3) led to a significant increase in electric myocardial impedance. However, after 2 days this edema had faded away such that it no longer disturbed rejection diagnosis.
We conclude that the registration of the electric myocardial impedance diagnoses humoral rejection episodes after heart transplantation not only reliably but also early, that is, before the onset of irreversible graft damage."

[Ultrasound diagnosis of the transplanted kidney].	Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation. Its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow-up. Simple B-mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures, while color-coded duplex sonography (CCDS) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion. More recent technical advances such as power Doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation. The possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts.

Downregulation of intragraft IFN-gamma expression correlates with increased IgG1 alloantibody response following intrathymic immunomodulation of sensitized rat recipients.	A single intrathymic injection of donor-specific spleen cells (2 x 10(7)) abrogates accelerated (24 hr) rejection of LBNF1 cardiac allografts in presensitized LEW rats and prolongs graft survival to about 11 days. This effect is donor-specific, gamma-irradiation-sensitive, thymus-dependent, and requires no concomitant therapy. We have recently shown that following intrathymic alloantigen administration, there is an earlier and increased systemic production of alloreactive IgM, and subsequently a premature isotype switching to IgG with the predominant IgG1 and IgG2a alloantibody responses. There is also a preferential binding of these IgG subclasses to the endothelium of well-functioning allografts. In this work, we analyzed the early cell activation and related cytokine elaboration patterns at the mRNA and protein levels by competitive template RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We found that prolonged cardiac allograft survival following intrathymic administration of donor spleen cells in presensitized rats was associated with markedly depressed intragraft IFN gamma mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, intrathymic allostimulation has led to a defect in the IL-2 pathway as the expression of IL-2 and IL-2R protein at the graft site was inhibited despite stable IL-2 mRNA levels. The inhibition of cell activation was also demonstrated by reduced MHC class II and the lack of ICAM-1, and TNF-alpha expression by immunohistochemistry. The expression of biologically active IL-12 (p70) by mononuclear and endothelial cells was detected in rejecting grafts between 3 and 12 hr. The well-functioning grafts after intrathymic allostimulation were devoid of IL-12 (p70), which in turn may have contributed to the downregulation of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein. Treatment with r.IFN-gamma, but not with r.IL-2, recreated the rejection response, and the characteristic IgG subclass pattern associated with accelerated graft loss. Hence, intrathymic immunomodulation with alloantigen results in selective inhibition of IFN-gamma-producing cells and a preferential upregulation of IgG1 alloantibodies. These data support the notion of the interlocked immunoregulatory roles of cytokine and alloantibody networks in rat allograft recipients.

Very low monocytic HLA-DR expression indicates high risk of infection--immunomonitoring for patients after neurosurgery and patients during high dose steroid therapy.	In patients with disturbed immunoreactivity caused by trauma or immunosuppressive therapy infections are still a severe problem. To determine whether measurement of monocytic HLA-DR expression is useful for identifying patients with a high risk of infection after elective neurosurgery, blood was obtained from 57 patients during the first 3 days after surgery. HLA-DR expression was lower in 14 patients who developed infection, compared with patients with an uncomplicated postoperative course (p < 0.0001). Out of ten patients with less than 30% HLA-DR positive monocytes, nine developed infection. In 11 neurosurgical patients additional investigations were performed. Measurements in these patients show that HLA-DR expression decreased temporarily within hours after surgery, coinciding with a considerable increase of inflammatory cytokines in CSF, but, surprisingly, not in plasma. High plasma concentrations of ACTH and cortisol hours after surgery indicated a hypothalamus-pituitary axis response, probably involved in the downregulation of monocytic HLA-DR expression. Likewise, monitoring of dermatological patients (n = 10) who received high dose systemic steroids revealed a very low HLA-DR expression in those patients who later developed infection. Our studies show that very low HLA-DR expression indicates high risk of infection. We recommend the measurement of this parameter for immunomonitoring.

Immunodepression following neurosurgical procedures.	"To determine the influence of a selective, sterile central nervous system surgery on immune reactivity, particularly whether a decrease of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression, indicating immunodepression, occurs after neurosurgery and if this measurement is useful for identification of patients with a high risk of infection.
Prospective study.
Department of neurosurgery and intensive care unit in a university hospital.
Blood samples were obtained from 46 patients at least once during the first 3 days after undergoing sterile central nervous system surgery. Fourteen of these patients developed infectious complications as defined by clinical and microbiological criteria. In ten of 46 patients, paired samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid were collected from a ventricle drain at the following times: 1 day before surgery; several times on the day of surgery; and every day after surgery for at least 6 days.
Monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression, as measured by flow cytometry on days 1 through 3 after surgery in 46 patients, was lower in 14 patients who developed infection after neurosurgery (p < .0001). In all ten closely monitored patients, monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression decreased temporarily after surgery. Of these patients, only one patient showed a persistent and considerably decreased monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression. This patient was the only patient in this subgroup who developed sepsis syndrome. In order to assess whether the monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR decrease was associated with a preceding inflammatory response, local and systemic concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma were measured in this subgroup. These cytokines were not detectable in plasma during the first days after surgery. In contrast, considerable increases of IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were detectable in cerebrospinal fluid within hours after surgery.
A decrease of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression occurs after neurosurgery and is associated with a preceding, strong, intracranial (but not systemic) inflammatory response. A very low monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression (< 30% positive monocytes) suggests the possibility of infection. Measurement of monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR expression could help to detect patients with a high risk of infection after neurosurgery. Our results suggest that even sterile central nervous system surgery may contribute to general immunodepression. The local intracranial inflammatory response may be involved in this process."

Lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-10 in mice: role of endogenous tumor necrosis factor-alpha.	Interleukin (IL)-10 is known to protect mice against the lethal effects of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and is considered to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine which suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have examined the interactions of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) with IL-10. Neutralization of TNF-alpha in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a significant reduction of LPS-inducible IL-10 production. In mice, injection of 5 mg/kg LPS induced circulating IL-10 with a biphasic time course exhibiting an early peak 1.5 h after challenge (synchronous with TNF-alpha) and, after a nadir at 6 h, a second increase between 8 and 12 h. Treatment of mice with neutralizing anti-mouse TNF-alpha antiserum significantly increased LPS-induced IL-10 plasma levels between 1.5 and 6 h but diminished those at 12 h, while circulating IL-6, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentrations were attenuated overall, without a biphasic response. Analysis of LPS-induced IL-10 mRNA expression in different tissues 1 h and 8 h after LPS or LPS plus anti-TNF-alpha revealed that the amount of transcripts in the liver correlated with circulating early and late IL-10 levels. Our findings suggest that endogenous TNF-alpha down-regulates the early and up-regulates the late LPS-induced IL-10 synthesis in vivo and that the liver is the major source of circulating IL-10 after stimulation with LPS.

Mechanism of endotoxin desensitization: involvement of interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor beta.	Tolerance of monocytes/macrophages to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) can be induced both in vivo and in vitro by LPS itself. Exposure to LPS, even at a very low dose, induces a downregulation of cytokine response to a second high dose LPS challenge. To learn more about the unknown mechanisms of this phenomenon, we studied the role of antiinflammatory cytokines in this process. Preculture of human peripheral blood monocytes for 24 hours with low concentrations of LPS induced hyporesponsiveness to high-dose LPS rechallenge with respect to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interleukin (IL) 10 but not IL-1RA production. These results suggest that LPS tolerance reflects a functional switch of monocytes rather than a general LPS hyporesponsiveness. IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 showed additive effects in replacing LPS for induction of LPS hyporesponsiveness in vitro. Additionally, neutralizing anti-IL-10 and anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibodies prevented induction of LPS tolerance. In vitro induced LPS tolerance looks like the ex vivo LPS hyporesponsiveness of monocytes from septic patients with fatal outcome: downregulation of LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-10 production but not of IL-1RA secretion. LPS hyporesponsiveness in septic patients was preceded by expression of IL-10 at both the mRNA and protein level. In summary, our data suggests that IL-10 and TGF-beta mediate the phenomenon of LPS tolerance in vitro and perhaps in vivo (septic patients), too.

We explored the ex vivo alteration in the cytokine release of stimulated blood taken from healthy volunteers treated subcutaneously with 480 micrograms granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). In a double-blind, controlled, randomized study with 21 volunteers who received G-CSF once or twice 24 hours apart, we measured lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible release of various cytokines and soluble receptors at different times after treatment. At day 1 after a single dose of G-CSF, mediator release was also initiated with muramyl dipeptide, Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A, lipoteichoic acid, streptolysin O, complement factor C5a, phytohemagglutinin, or phorbol myristate acetate. In blood from G-CSF-treated subjects, our major findings were (1) a maximal 12-fold increase in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) release and an increase of both the p55 and p75 soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors; (2) a reduction in TNF release when using all the various stimuli described except LPS; (3) an increase in G-CSF and, to lesser extent, in IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 release; and (4) an attenuation of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF release. Our findings demonstrate that the major effect of G-CSF treatment is a change in the responsiveness of blood towards a variety of stimuli, which we interpret as a shift toward an antiinflammatory cytokine response.

Stimulation of the human cytomegalovirus IE enhancer/promoter in HL-60 cells by TNFalpha is mediated via induction of NF-kappaB.	TNFalpha enhances the basal activity of the major Immediate Early (IE) enhancer/promoter of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the immature premonocytic HL-60 cell line. The stimulatory effect of TNFalpha is mediated by induction of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which specifically binds to the 18-bp repetitive sequence motif of the enhancer region. Complex formation could be competed by oligonucleotides representing the 18-bp sequence motif or the prototype NF-kappaB sequence of the immunoglobulin kappa gene. In gel mobility shift assays antisera specific to NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits were shown to react with the DNA-protein complex. Addition of the antioxidant PDTC blocked TNFalpha-mediated stimulation in a dose dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that PDTC prevents NF-kappaB induction. Furthermore, it is suggested that protein kinases like PK-C are involved in the TNFalpha signal transduction pathway which leads to the activation of NF-kappaB and its binding to the HCMV IE enhancer in HL-60 cells. Our data are consistent with a role of TNFalpha in reactivation of latent HCMV infection in premonocytic cells.

Up-regulation of monocytic IL-10 by tumor necrosis factor-alpha and cAMP elevating drugs.	It is well established that endotoxin [lipopolysacharide (LPS)] induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production in monocytes, which is followed by secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. IL-10 down-regulates inflammatory response [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8] as well as IL-10 synthesis itself. We wondered whether pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha may be involved in the regulation of human IL-10 synthesis. TNF-alpha induced de novo IL-10 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner but no IL-10 protein in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, LPS-induced IL-10 gene and protein expression was significantly inhibited by neutralizing anti-TNF-alpha mAb. On the basis of these results, we conclude that TNF-alpha is involved in the up-regulation of its antagonist IL-10. Paradoxically, drugs that effectively inhibit expression of TNF-alpha via the elevation of intracellular cAMP level (iloprost, pentoxifylline, prostaglandin E2 and N6,2-O-dibutyryl cAMP) augmented the endotoxin-induced IL-10 synthesis at both protein and mRNA levels. In order to provide a basis for the analysis of the transcriptional regulation of the human IL-10 gene, we isolated a fragment of the human IL-10 gene containing 1308 bp of the 5' non-coding sequence. It shows remarkable homology to the mouse IL-10 promoter in regions that have been associated with transcriptional regulation, including a cAMP responsive element which could explain the cAMP-mediated effects. The lack of a NF-kappa B-like binding site in the human sequence suggests a NF-kappa B-independent mechanism of TNF-alpha-induced IL-10 gene activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	International immunology	1995-04-01	10.1093/intimm/7.4.517	['Platzer,C', 'Meisel,C', 'Vogt,K', 'Platzer,M', 'Volk,HD']	['Institute of Medical Immunology, Charité, Humboldt University Berlin, Germany.', None, None, None, None]

A novel multispecific competitor fragment for quantitative PCR analysis of cytokine gene expression in rats.	Competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a sensitive method for quantification of cytokine mRNA expression. Co-amplification of an internal standard serves as control for comparing the efficiency of PCR in different samples. We have developed a novel control fragment for multiple analyses of rat cytokine gene expression containing primers for IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, IFN-gamma and MIP-2. Additional primers were incorporated to analyse the content of T cells (CD3), activated T cells (CD25) and housekeeping genes (beta-actin and HPRT). As an example we demonstrate analysis of IL-2 mRNA expression in small pieces of kidney tissue obtained from rats after kidney allotransplantation. The IL-2 expression decreased tenfold during treatment with an anti-rat CD4 monoclonal antibody as compared to untreated animals.

Late-acute renal allograft rejection and symptomless cytomegalovirus infection.	The role of cytomegalovirus infection in allograft injury is controversial. A subgroup of renal graft recipients who had histologically proven late-acute rejection did not respond to conventional anti-rejection therapy (80% graft loss within 1 year). These patients showed an expansion of memory-type CD8 peripheral-blood T cells that expressed interferon-gamma mRNA and an association with clinically symptomless cytomegalovirus infection (82% PCR positive, 42% antigenaemia). Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir resulted in stable improved graft function in 17 of 21 treated patients with cytomegalovirus-associated late-acute rejection. The results underline the clinical relevance of cytomegalovirus-related graft injury and offer a novel therapeutic approach.

Cytomegalovirus infection in transplant recipients. The role of tumor necrosis factor.	Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. CMV infection commonly results from the reactivation of a latent infection. Using a set of monoclonal anti-CMV antibodies, we found CMV antigen expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), particularly in monocytes, in 312 of 816 samples from 190 allograft recipients. The detection of CMV-IE antigens and CMV-IE DNA in PBMNC indicates that positive cells may represent truly infected cells. The relation between increased cytokine plasma levels (particularly following treatment by pan-T cell antibodies) and the appearance of CMV antigens in PBMNC suggests that cytokines may play an important role in the reversal of CMV latency. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is able to stimulate the activity of the CMV-IE enhancer/promoter region in the human monocytic cell line, HL-60. The interleukins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10; transforming growth factor-beta; interferongamma; and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor did not show any enhancing effect on the CMV promoter activity. Thus, TNF-alpha seems to play a key role in regulating the balance between latency and reactivation of CMV infection. Inhibition of TNF-alpha release or action may be an alternative strategy for preventing CMV-associated morbidity in allograft recipients.

Mechanisms of dichotomous action of IL-2-Pseudomonas exotoxin 40 (IL-2-PE40) on cell-mediated and humoral immune response.	IL-2-PE40 is a chimeric protein composed of human IL-2 genetically fused to the amino terminus of a modified form of Pseudomonas exotoxin lacking its cell recognition domain. The immunosuppressive efficacy of IL-2-PE40 was demonstrated in several experimental murine transplant and autoimmune models. However, some observations suggested that IL-2-PE40 could not inhibit the humoral response. In this report, we describe the dichotomous effects of IL-2-PE40 on humoral and cell-mediated immune response in a simple, well characterized in vivo model. Although IL-2-PE40 inhibited the cell-mediated delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to SRBC, it increased the humoral immune response to the same Ag. To understand the mechanism of dichotomous action of IL-2-PE40 on the immune response, IL-2R-bearing T cells were treated with IL-2-PE40 in vitro and the cytokine expression was studied at mRNA and protein level. Similar to IL-2, IL-2-PE40 promoted the expression of T helper 1-like (IFN-gamma) as well as T helper 2-like (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines. These in vitro studies show that IL-2-PE40 can induce signal transduction in activated T cells through the IL-2R before exerting its cytotoxic effect. In contrast to DTH reaction, humoral immune response requires T cell help only for a limited period. Therefore, the short-term stimulation of T helper cells by IL-2-PE40 may be sufficient in vivo to mediate a B cell response in the local environment, whereas the DTH reaction and other cell-mediated immune responses are inhibited by the toxin moiety of the chimeric protein.

Late acute rejection in long-term renal allograft recipients. Diagnostic and predictive value of circulating activated T cells.	"Episodes of acute rejection can occur in functional renal grafts even at a very late stage after transplantation. They are not necessarily due to patient noncompliance. The incidence of late acute rejection is commonly underestimated because the diagnosis generally requires histopathology in order to rule out other origins of declining graft function, even more so, as the typical signs of acute rejection as seen in the early posttransplantation period (sudden and rapid increase of creatinine serum level, inflammatory signs) are missing. Histology revealed acute rejection in 157 of 412 renal allograft recipients suffering from progressive graft deterioration between the 2nd and 18th year after Tx. Late acute rejection was clearly associated with elevated levels of activated HLA-DR+ T cells in the peripheral blood. These cells were characterized by flow cytometry to be postmitotic activated effector-T cells belonging to the CD4+ and CD8+ ""memory"" T cell pool. The high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (88%) of flow cytometric analysis allows for the discrimination between late acute rejection and other causes of deteriorating graft function (infection, toxicity, arteriopathy, chronic rejection). Additionally, this immune monitoring can predict the success of antirejection therapy as early as a few days after initiation of treatment while conventional parameters do not reflect the therapeutic result until 1-3 weeks later. In addition to this, peripheral T cell activation also seems to identify a subgroup of patients with chronic rejection who would respond, at least partially, to steroid bolus therapy. As a result, this parameter is very useful for the clinical management of patients suffering from late deterioration of renal graft function."

Precursor frequencies for DNA-specific B lymphocytes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).	Precursor frequencies for anti-DNA-secreting B cells were estimated in six healthy donors and 18 SLE patients with active and inactive disease. Precursors for IgG anti-dsDNA-secreting B cells were exclusively detected in SLE patients (73% of active patients and one inactive patient, 0.01-0.99% of IgG-producing B cells). These frequencies were in the same order of magnitude as frequencies of precursors for IgG anti-tetanus toxoid, which were detectable in three healthy volunteers after booster vaccination (0.07-0.8% of IgG-producing B cells), but not before (< 0.01%). Precursors for IgG anti-ss-DNA secreting B cells were observed in 33% of healthy donors and in 78% of SLE patients (0.01-0.32% of IgG-producing B cells). Only patient-derived IgG anti-DNA clones cross-reacted with (33%) or were monoreactive to dsDNA (12%). Precursors for IgM anti-DNA-secreting B cells were observed in healthy donors and SLE patients in comparable frequencies and with similar reactivities with ssDNA and dsDNA. Segregation analyses and sorting experiments showed that > 94% of clones secreting IgG anti-DNA were derived from in vivo sIgG+ B cells. sIgM+ B cells were induced to switch in vitro; however, only twice were cultures containing IgM and IgG anti-DNA antibodies observed under clonal conditions. In conclusion, our results indicate that precursor B cells for IgG anti-dsDNA in SLE patients are similarly selected and expanded as are precursor B cells specific for foreign antigens such as tetanus toxoid.

Discordant expression of LFA-1, VLA-4alpha, VLA-beta 1, CD45RO and CD28 on T-cell subsets: evidence for multiple subsets of 'memory' T cells.	Several adhesion molecules and CD45RO have been reported to be upregulated on the cell surface of 'memory' T cells. Using triple-color flow cytometry, we compared the levels of typical 'memory' cell markers on peripheral blood T-cell subpopulations in a number of kidney transplant recipients, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, newborn infants and healthy donors. CD45RO, VLA-beta 1 (CD29), VLA-5 alpha (CD49e), LFA-1 (CD11a/18), and CD2 were found to be closely coregulated on CD4+ T cells, while regulation of VLA-2 alpha (Cd49b), VLA-4 alpha (CD49d) and CD44 was quite discordant. In CD8+ T cells, by contrast, multiple subsets of 'memory'-type cells were distinguished. Unlike TCR alpha/beta T cells, which expressed either high or low levels of LFA-1, TCR gamma/delta cells all expressed high levels of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). Examination of T cells from kidney graft fine-needle aspiration biopsies during rejection revealed intragraft accumulation of 'memory'-type T cells expressing high levels of CD2 and LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). Regarding peripheral blood T-cell subsets, differences between patients and healthy controls were only of a quantitative nature.

Interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 concentrations as predictors of outcome in ventricular assist device patients before heart transplantation.	"To determine whether the serum concentrations of some circulating cytokines (as highly sensitive markers of inflammation) are of value in predicting the outcome of patients with cardiogenic shock and end-stage heart disease, who undergo ventricular assist device implantation until heart transplantation.
Cohort study.
University teaching hospitals.
Twenty patients with cardiogenic shock or end-stage heart disease were consecutively selected for this study, if assist device implantation was performed as a bridge to heart transplantation.
The circulating concentrations of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were monitored from the beginning to the end of assist device support two to three times a week, using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In all patients, circulating IL-6 and IL-8 values were increased shortly after assist device implantation. In patients with uncomplicated courses, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations decreased after an initial increase and were low at the time of transplantation, whereas serum cytokine concentrations increased and remained increased in the nonsurvivors (survivors vs. nonsurvivors, p < .001). Circulating IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha concentrations were rarely detectable.
Monitoring of IL-6 and IL-8 values during ventricular assist device support provides a means of early identification of high-risk patients that may allow optimization of antimicrobial therapy and selection of the appropriate time for transplantation."

Monitoring of the cellular immune system in patients with biventricular assist devices awaiting cardiac transplantation.	"Lack of objective parameters to predict the clinical course and outcome are a major problem in managing the patients selected for BVAD-support as a bridge to heart transplantation. This study was intended to assess whether cellular immune parameters have a predictive value for the clinical result of VAD-support. Various cellular immune markers were monitored by multiparameter cytofluorometry in 30 patients who received a VAD system (Berlin Heart). We did not find significant differences in preoperative values of immune parameters between groups of survivors (n = 14) and non-survivors (n = 16). All 9 patients who died of septic multiple organ failure (MOF) had shown increased levels of T-cell activation (CD 71, CD 25, HLA-DR) as well as leukocytosis and 7 patients who died of noninfectious complications (mostly hemorrhage or cerebral complications) had exhibited T-lymphopenia. Seven of 9 patients who died of septic MOF had extremely decreased levels of HLA-DR+ monocytes (< 30%) while all 14 survivors and all 7 patients who died of noninfectious complications showed almost normal monocytic HLA-DR antigen expression, antigen-presenting capacity and cytokine secretion. These observations point to the reduced antimicrobial immunity (""immunoparalysis"") in the non-survivors and may explain the fatal course of infection in these individuals. The in vitro results of restitution experiments call for new therapeutic strategies to improve the survival of VAD-patients."

Binding of natural human IgM auto-antibodies to human tumor cell lines and stimulated normal T lymphocytes.	In a recent publication we described the binding of natural IgM antibodies derived from the human fetal B cell repertoire to the cell surface of some human tumor cells including colon carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer and B lymphoma lines [1]. Further analyses showed that a similar molecule was bound by the respective monoclonal human antibodies on the cell surface of polyclonally stimulated human CD3+ T cells, but is absent from unstimulated MNC. Both CD4+ and CD8+ stimulated cells were recognized. The molecule was found to be expressed together with lymphocyte activation markers (4F2, CD72, CD25). The membrane antigen expressed on both the activated T lymphocytes and tumor cells was characterized in a 2-D electrophoresis system: molecular weight 55-60 kDa, pI-approximately 6.0. Whereas the proliferation capacity of tumor cells was detected to be decreased significantly in the presence of the binding antibodies, no influence on [3H]thymidine uptake into stimulated T cells was found, suggesting different functional consequences of binding the respective antigen on malignant and normal cells. An interesting finding is the enhanced expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on tumor cells incubated with human natural antibodies.

Cytomegalovirus reactivation and tumour necrosis factor.	Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) stimulates cytomegalovirus (CMV) activity in a transfected human monocytic cell line. We assessed whether this finding is relevant in vivo by evaluating the frequency of active CMV infection in patients with diseases that enhance plasma TNF. In septic disease, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of almost all patients studied were positive for CMV. Furthermore, CMV antigenaemia and enhanced plasma TNF occurred in many patients with liver cirrhosis, common variable immunodeficiency, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Thus, TNF may have a central role in CMV reactivation.

[Immunologic parameters in women with normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia].	Immunological investigations were carried in women with normal pregnancy and patients with preeclampsia. Regarding the lymphocyte subpopulation distribution an elevated number of T lymphocytes, especially of CD-4 carrying helper-inducer T cells, was registered resulting in an altered CD4/CD8 ratio. The T lymphocytes in patients with pre-eclampsia seem to be activated in vivo, shown by an elevated expression of the CD25 (IL-2 receptor) marker. Their responsibility to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in vitro was found to be depressed. Furthermore, a pre-stimulation of macrophages in vivo was registered (expression of the transferrin receptor). In comparison to the control group the serum levels of IgG and IgA were seen to be low in patients with pre-eclampsia.

Tumour necrosis factor alpha stimulates the activity of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate early enhancer/promoter in immature monocytic cells.	Both tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate early (IE) enhancer/promoter activity in the HL-60 granulocyte/monocyte progenitor cell line when added to transfected cells. In U-937 monocytic cells, by contrast, TNF-alpha had no stimulatory effect and the addition of PMA produced only marginal stimulation. In the mature THP-1 monocytic cell line and in differentiated HL-60 cells, addition of TNF-alpha caused inhibition of the IE enhancer/promoter activity. The stimulating effect of PMA, as observed in the other cell lines, however, remained. Thus the effect of TNF-alpha on the major IE enhancer/promoter activity is determined by the degree of differentiation of the infected cells. Unlike TNF-alpha and PMA, the interleukins IL-1, IL-3, IL-6 as well as the cytokine GM-CSF were found to have no detectable influence on the activity of the IE enhancer/promoter activity which, likewise, was not affected by the presence of the modulator sequence. Since premonocytic cells are suggested to be sites of HCMV latency, the stimulation by TNF-alpha could be of potential pathophysiological significance.

Immune restoration in children after partial splenectomy.	Splenectomy (SE) is recognized to be a therapeutical approach in treating children with severe autoimmune diseases (chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenia; hemolytic anemia) or hypersplenism because of portal hypertension. Nevertheless, removal of a main immune organ results in elevated infection risk for these patients. Partial splenectomy (PSE) was developed as a therapeutical compromise to retain immunologically active spleen tissue. Here, we document the analysis of immune parameters obtained from children after both partial and total splenectomy, which have been followed up for a period of more than 6 years: (i) Lymphocytes from both groups of patients failed to produce IgG in response to pokeweed mitogen in vitro. This was observed in 11/20 splenectomized patients even 10 years after operation, whereas in PSE patients a restoration of this parameter after 1-2 years was seen. (ii) In patients after PSE, but not in splenectomized persons, an elevated number of HLA-class II positive cells had been detected suggesting a different situation of immune regulation following this operation. However, in parallel with an improvement of B cell in vitro activity this parameter was found to achieve normal values. Our findings indicate that partial splenectomy may be a therapeutical alternative, if the therapeutic goal can be achieved by this procedure.

The effect of splenopentin (DA SP-5) on in vitro myelopoiesis and on AZT-induced bone marrow toxicity.	Splenopentin (DA SP-5) is a pentapeptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence 32-36 (Arg-Lys-Glu-Val-Tyr) of the splenic hormone splenin. We examined the influence of DA SP-5 on bone marrow progenitor cell (BMC) proliferation. DA SP-5 acts as a co-stimulant for recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF) in the induction of human BMC derived colony formation in vitro (colony-forming units). When exposed to DA SP-5 and thereafter to AZT and rHuGM-CSF, BMCs show a colony-forming response similar to that after cultivation with the rHuGM-CSF alone. In contrast, when exposed to AZT and rHuGM-CSF (and not preincubated with DA SP-5) the colony formation was reduced. A similar pentapeptide thymopentin (Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr) did not influence colony formation by human BMCs. We assume that DA SP-5 could support therapeutic effects of rHuGM-CSF.

In vitro stimulation of human fetal lymphocytes by mitogens and interleukins.	Human lymphocytes derived from fetal spleen and liver were studied for their capacity to respond to mitogens and interleukins using different in vitro models (cell volume increase, [3H]thymidine incorporation, Ig secretion). Although the number of mature B and T cells in the fetal liver preparations remained nearly constant [Settmacher et al. (1991) Immunobiol. 182, 256], only lymphocytes obtained from fetal organisms before the 25th week of gestation could respond to some of the polyclonal stimulators (PWM, anti-CD3 + IL-2, SAC + IL-2, SAC + IL-4) tested, whereas cells obtained after that period failed. In the fetal spleen, however, with increasing percentages of mature B and T cells during fetal development, a growing ability to respond to mitogens was registered, which, however, did not achieve the values found for the adult spleen material.

Induction of long-term survival of rat skin allografts by a novel, highly efficient anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody.	The new monoclonal antirat CD4 antibody RIB 5/2, which detects another epitope than those covered by W3/25 and MRC OX35, was tested for its immunosuppressive potency following skin allografting by using strain combinations with different genetic barriers in the MHC and genetic low- or high-responder background. High-dose and long-term therapy of the grafted rats led to a significant delay of the acute rejection (P < 0.01) in the strain combination Wistar Furth-to-BDX as well as in LEW1W-to-LEW1A. No significant prolongation of the mean allograft survival time was obtained for the high-responder rats (LEW1A-to-LEW1W). Cytofluorometric analysis revealed that RIB 5/2 exerts the immunosuppressive activity predominantly by modulation of the CD4 glycoprotein. Furthermore, the dependence of the humoral immune response against the mouse-globulins upon the administered protein quantity could be demonstrated.

[Treatment of autoimmune diseases and graft rejection with anti-CD4 antibodies].	Based on the experience that T helper lymphocytes play an important part in the initiation and maintenance of various autoimmune diseases and also in graft rejection, novel therapeutic approaches have been developed and are under investigation. They are aimed at selective inhibition of T cells whose activation is unwanted. Useful tools for this purpose are monoclonal antibodies to cell surface molecules which are restricted to certain cell populations. In this review the concept of treatment with antibodies to CD4-a surface molecule characteristic of T helper lymphocytes-is discussed. Encouraged by experimental experiences obtained during the past years, a series of case reports were published and clinical pilot studies have been performed, the preliminary results of which are now becoming available. Anti-CD4 therapy appears to be a promising approach. Short-lasting effects can be separated from long-lived effects. The latter are not easy to explain, although hypotheses have been developed still requiring more detailed experimental confirmation.

Human monoclonal IgM antibodies from foetal B-cell hybridomas directed against a surface antigen on human tumour cells.	In order to assess the existence of B lymphocytes capable of producing anti-tumour antibodies in non-tumour-bearing individuals, human lymphocytes derived from foetuses and adults were fused with the heteromyeloma cell line CB-F7. By indirect immunofluorescence, 29 out of 4,472 IgM-producing hybridomas (from 8 foetuses and 8 adults) were shown to produce antibodies which bind to colon carcinoma lines Colo205 and SW620, Raji lymphoma cells and small cell carcinoma of the lung. In vitro growth of tumour cells recognized by these antibodies was inhibited. The antibodies also mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity. All antibodies tested recognized a cell surface molecule of 55 kDa. Southern blot hybridization analysis of hybridoma DNA with a human JH probe showed that the hybridomas were derived from clonally unrelated B cells. These results demonstrate that human foetal and adult B cells from non-tumour-bearing individuals are able to produce IgM antibodies recognizing defined cell surface molecules expressed on some tumour cells.

CD3+ CD57+ lymphocytes are not likely to be involved in antigen-specific rejection processes in long-term allograft recipients.	Cytofluorometric investigation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in 380 long-term (greater than 1 year posttransplantation) allograft recipients showed a significant increase in the proportion of CD3+57+ lymphocytes (greater than 20%) in 20% of patients with renal allografts, 66% of patients with cardiac allografts and 44% of patients with liver allografts. Most of these CD3+57+ cells expressed the CD8 antigen and a variable proportion the HLA-DR antigen. A retrospective analysis showed a poorer prognosis for the clinical outcome in those patients with elevated numbers of CD3+57+ cells in peripheral blood. However, CD57+ lymphocytes could rarely be detected in renal infiltrates by immunohistology. Using the Southern blot technique to analyse the T cell receptor rearrangement of separated CD57+ cells, no clonal or oligoclonal expansion of T cell clones could be detected. Nevertheless, there might be a bias towards the use of particular TCR-V beta gene families in at least some patients, as shown by analysis with monoclonal antibodies. In summary, CD57+ T cells are not likely to be directly involved in the rejection process. The data support the idea of a polyclonal and/or superantigen-driven expansion, but not of an antigen-driven expansion of these cells.

Lymphocyte surface marker expression on hybridomas secreting human monoclonal antibodies.	The expression of human leucocyte markers on the surface of hybridoma cell lines producing human monoclonal antibodies was studied using immunofluorescence analysis (FACS). We tested 36 different hybridoma cell lines from fusions of lymphocytes of different organs of fetal and adult organisms with the mouse myeloma line P3 X63 Ag8.653 or the mouse-human heteromyeloma line CB-F7 (IgM-, IgG-, and nonproducer) with a panel of 21 murine monoclonal antibodies against human differentiation and activation antigens. CD2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 23, 25 antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II determinants could not be detected on all hybridomas analyzed. The antigens CD22, 69, 71, and 72 were expressed on few of the hybridomas tested. The majority of the cell lines carried the surface markers CD19, 20, 40, 45 as well as the plasma cell markers CD38 and O/C11. The activation antigen 4F2 was expressed on all the cell lines tested. However, a direct connection between the expression of a lymphocyte marker and the capacity for Ig production (high and low producer; Ig isotype), the origin of the lymphocytes, and the fusion cell line used could not be detected.

Diagnostic and predictive value of an immune monitoring program for complications after kidney transplantation.	We have tested an immune monitoring program consisting of cytofluorometric analysis of lymphocytic and monocytic markers, using a set of different monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in about 500 transplant patients including about 300 long-term renal allograft recipients. The high sensitivity (95%) of these cytofluorometric analyses in the peripheral blood allows to discriminate between acute rejection and other causes of deteriorated kidney transplant function (infection, toxicity, arteriopathy), especially in the late phase (> 1 year) after transplantation. Additionally, the immune monitoring is sufficient to predict success of antirejection therapy as early as a few days after onset of treatment. A life-threatening complication in allograft recipients is septic disease. Proceeding from immune parameters, septic patients were found to fall into two categories: those with decreased expression of HLA-DR on monocytes (< 20%, termed as 'immunoparalysis') and patients with nearly normal HLA-DR+ monocytes. Septic immunoparalysis requires drastic reduction of immunosuppression (mortality after drastic reduction: 8%; after marginal reduction or without reduction: 90%). We have not observed severe rejection as a consequence of reduced immunosuppression in such patients. Our immune monitoring seems to be useful for management of immunosuppression in patients with unclear deterioration in graft function as well as patients with septic complications in order to minimize two risks, i.e. death by sepsis or loss of graft.

[Immunorestitutive action of hydrolysates and ultrafiltrates of bovine spleen].	Investigations with different spleen extracts of varied composition and purity have shown immunomodulatory effects. In the present study the in vivo effect of a bovine spleen hydrolysate (Prosplen) on a radiation-induced immunodeficiency model is demonstrated. Intraperitoneal application of 1 mg/g bw hydrolysate 3/times a week caused a highly significant acceleration of the restitution of the humoral and cell-mediated immunoreactivity towards sheep erythrocytes in sublethally (600 cGy) radiated mice: plaque-forming cells in the spleen, hemagglutination, hemolysistiter of the serum, delayed type of hypersensitivity = DTH reaction. The immunoreactivity of the treated groups reached normal levels within 6-8 weeks, whereas in the groups receiving placebo this was observed after 10 weeks at the earliest. Cytofluorometric investigations revealed an accelerated restitution of the B-lymphocyte fraction in the spleen. Mice that was not irradiated showed no effect after treatment with the hydrolysate. Similar results were obtained using an ultrafiltrate of the hydrolysate.

Comparative analysis of the influences of IL-1, IL-3 and GM-CSF on the commitment of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in vitro.	Our experiments were directed towards the detection of the influence of interleukin-1 (IL-1); interleukin-3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) on the generation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. We also set out to examine whether this process is connected with changes within the early precursor cell compartment. Bone marrow suspension cultures (12 days) supplemented with these cytokines were tested for the presence of GM colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) in a colony-forming unit assay. The percentage of CD34+ and HLA-DR+ as well as the number of blasts and promyelocytes were estimated cytofluorometrically and morphologically. The proliferative effect of GM-CSF was associated with a net increase of GM-CFC and HLA-DR+ myeloid cells and a decrease in the percentage of CD34+ early precursor cells. IL-3 acted similarly and also caused an absolute decrease of CD34+ cells in the cultures. IL-1 did not stimulate the generation of blasts or GM-CFC but elevated the number of CD34- as well as HLA-DR-expressing cells in the cultures. These results imply that GM-CSF supported the maintenance of hematopoiesis in vitro. The transition from early precursor cells to committed myeloid progenitor cells (GM-CFC) and more mature precursor cells (G-CFC, M-CFC) may be supported by GM-CSF without affecting the self-renewing capacity of CD34+ early precursors. In contrast, the blast-generating and proliferation-inducing action of IL-3 is associated with a drop in the total number of CD34+ stem cells. An efficient renewal of this population obviously depends on the presence of IL-1.

Characterization of human lymphocytes separated from fetal liver and spleen at different stages of ontogeny.	Membrane markers on human lymphocytes separated from fetal liver and spleen were studied. Depending on the period of intrauterine development, a growing percentage of T- and B-lymphocytes (up to 16% and 45%, respectively) among spleen cells was seen, but in liver the number was low independent of the gestational age (T cells less than 10% and B cells less than 15%). The majority of early CD3+ spleen cells (21st-28th week) expressed TCR alpha beta but not TCR gamma delta, although a significant proportion of these cells was still lacking CD4, CD8, and CD5 differentiation antigens, suggesting their immaturity. Later spleen T cells (29th-36th week) expressed the phenotype as mature adult-type T cells (CD3+TCR alpha beta +CD4/8+CD5+). During ontogeny in fetal spleen, a growing number of B cells could be estimated without any changes in the proportion of subsets, expressing the different light and heavy chains. However, the proportion of CD5+ B cells decreased with gestational age. The results suggest that the functional immaturity of antenatal splenocytes could not be caused by dramatic phenotypical differences in comparison with adult-type splenic lymphocytes.

Tumor suppression after tumor cell-targeted tumor necrosis factor alpha gene transfer.	The tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene was introduced by retroviral gene transfer into the TNF-alpha-insensitive tumor cell line J558L. Production of 40 pg/ml TNF-alpha by clone J2T12 consistently did not change the growth rate in vitro, but drastically suppressed tumor growth when injected into syngeneic BALB/c mice. Within 2 wk, 90% of the mice inoculated with J558L cells developed a tumor, but none of the mice injected with J2T12 did so. Within the observation period (greater than 3 mo), 60% of the mice inoculated with J2T12 did not develop a tumor. In the other 40% of the mice, tumor manifestation was significantly delayed. Mice injected simultaneously with J2T12 cells and an anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody developed tumors similar to parental J558L cells. Similarly, the tumor-suppressive effects of TNF-alpha were abolished, e.g., by injection of an anti-type 3 complement receptor (CR3) monoclonal antibody that is known to prevent migration of inflammatory cells. These results and the observation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages suggest that lack of tumorigenicity of J2T12 cells is due to the TNF-alpha secretion by the tumor cells and that TNF-alpha acts indirectly by a mechanism that involves chemotactic recruitment and activation of cells, predominantly of macrophages. In contrast, the tumor growth was not affected when, instead of TNF-alpha, interleukin 6 was expressed by J558L cells. Together, our results support the concept of tumor cell-targeted cytokine gene transfer as a tool for cancer treatment, and particularly demonstrate that extremely low doses of TNF-alpha produced by tumor cells are sufficient to inhibit tumor growth without detectable side effects.

Human hybridomas derived from CD5+ B lymphocytes of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) produce multi-specific natural IgM (kappa) antibodies.	Great numbers of CD5+ B lymphocytes were detected in the peripheral blood of patients with B-CLL. To study the antibody repertoire of this immune cell subpopulation on a monoclonal level, we fused the lymphocytes derived from five different donors to a highly efficient HAT-sensitive heteromyeloma line (CB-F7). A fusion frequency of up to 10(-5) allowed us to analyse hundreds of initial hybridoma lines per fusion. In all culture supernatants in three out of five fusions IgM lambda antibodies were detected, in two experiments only IgM kappa was measured, suggesting monoclonality of the primary hybridoma cell lines. The later fusions resulted in hybridomas producing multi-specific antibodies against both an autoantigen and an infectious agent: (i) dsDNA/influenza virus haemagglutinin; (ii) dsDNA/class V outer membrane protein type C from Neisseria meningitidis. However, no antibodies of the described specificity were detected in blood sera of patients, indicating a 'switch-on' of the immunoglobulin secretion capacity of malignant B cells during fusion to a myeloma partner. We discuss the results as further evidence for the natural multi-reactive antibody repertoire of CD5+ B cells.

Prevention and suppression of autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction in BB rats by syngeneic lymphocytes obtained from long-term normoglycaemic donors.	To prove whether a cell-mediated mechanism is responsible for maintaining long-term normoglycaemia in BB/OK rats with a proved immune attack (insulitis, reduced Beta-cell volume), we transferred lymphocytes obtained from those rats into normoglycaemic diabetes-prone BB/OK rats or into diabetic BB/OK rats receiving a simultaneous syngeneic islet graft. Our results show the presence of a lymphocyte population in the long-term normoglycaemic BB/OK rats, which is able to arrest pancreatic Beta-cell destruction in diabetes-prone BB/OK rats detected by a decreased diabetes incidence following single lymphocyte transfusion. Syngeneic islets were destroyed by recurrence of the autoimmune process when transplanted into diabetic BB/OK rats. Lymphocytes obtained from long-term normoglycaemic BB/OK rats were able to protect the syngeneic BB/OK islet graft from autoimmune destruction in diabetic BB/OK rats, whereas allogeneic islet destruction was not prevented. The phenotype of the effective lymphocyte population is not yet clear, but it is negative for RT6. We conclude that the mechanism responsible for maintaining normoglycaemia in long-term normoglycaemic BB/OK rats is cell mediated, because this property can be transferred to prevent autoimmune destruction of pancreatic Beta cells.

Alterations in function and phenotype of monocytes from patients with septic disease--predictive value and new therapeutic strategies.	"Recently we described the predictive value of the proportion of HLA-DR+ peripheral blood monocytes for the clinical outcome of septic disease in immunosuppressed patients (allograft recipients) and surgical patients mostly with peritonitis as septic focus (following perforation of gastrointestinal tract). The experiments described here show that the loss of HLA-class II antigen expression and other phenotypical abnormalities of monocytes from septic patients with fatal outcome are associated with functional defects (antigen presentation, formation of reactive oxygen species, cytokine secretion). The picture of phenotypical and functional defects of monocytes was termed ""immunoparalysis"" (leading parameter: loss of HLA-DR antigen expression less than 20%). Interferon-gamma as well as GM-CSF normalized in vitro the surface antigen expression on monocytes derived from septic patients with ""immunoparalysis"". However, sera from patients with ""immunoparalysis"" prevented the cytokine-mediated effects on HLA-DR antigen expression. The inhibitory activity in septic sera was not dialysable. In order to remove such factors we started a plasmapheresis study in septic patients selected for ""immunoparalysis"". The preliminary data of this clinical trial suggest an improved survival rate."

The monoclonal antibody RIB5/1--a useful completion of the MRC OX-3 and OX-6 haplotype specificity.	The haplotype binding pattern of a new mAb RIB5/1 against RT1 class II antigens on different tissues of inbred rat strains was investigated using the indirect POD-technique and a cytofluorometric analysis. RIB5/1 binds to a polymorphic determinant of the RT1 class II glycoprotein. Unlike MRC OX-3 (and OX-6), RIB5/1 reacts in optimal dilution with the RT1 haplotypes dvl, a, av, g, 1 but not with u. Therefore, the mAb pair MRC OX-3 (OX-6) and RIB5/1 is applicable for specific immunohistological purposes in chimaeric models with these RT1 haplotypes.

Inhibition of cellular immune reactions by zymosan.	Mice treated intraperitoneally with zymosan showed a strong inhibition of the DTHR (delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction) against sheep erythrocytes (SE), ovalbumin (OA), and alloantigen. Furthermore, the rejection time of skin transplants was nearly doubled while antibody formation against SE was significantly enhanced. When a DTHR against OA and an antibody formation against SE were induced at the same time in the same animals, than the suppressive and stimulating effects cancelled each other. These results are discussed with regard to the sensitivity of lymphocyte subpopulations, which may be different if exposed to phagocytosis-induced oxygen radicals.

Correlations exist between CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD25 + T-Ly and both luminol-dependent CL and neutrophils (p less than 0.01). The results suggest, that increased secretion of RSM by BAL-cells may be caused by local release of lymphokines by these activated T-Ly. Therefore CFM and CL seem to be useful in addition to BAL cell differentiation in characterizing the BAL cell activity in the diagnostic of lung involvement in SS and SLE.

Electron microscopy of liver in patients with chronic haemodialysis.	Liver biopsies were performed on 18 haemodialysis patients with clinically as well as clinico-chemically altered liver values and partially positive HBV marker serology, with the view to comparing these values with ultrastructural findings in correlation with histological and immunohistological results. The following characteristic combination of findings was recorded at ultrastructural level: hypertrophy and hyperplasia of agranular endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, haemosiderin deposits in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes, invasion of lymphocytes into Disse and intercellular spaces; megamitochondria in hepatocytes and perisinusoidal fibrosis established in some cases. The same findings proved to be recordable in histological diagnosis of hepatitis or toxico-metabolic liver damage. The study shows that inflammatory lesions are not all the only causes for haemodialysis-related changes in clinico-chemical values, so that liver biopsies together with ultrastructural investigations are indicated for differential diagnosis.

[A whole-blood micromethod to determine lymphocyte subsets in capillary blood, comparison with other methods of indirect immunofluorescence].	Six lymphocyte antigens were detected with monoclonal antibodies in 0.2 ml capillary blood by a whole blood micromethod. After the lysis of erythrocytes of one drop of blood the remaining cells were layered on slides and were stained by indirect immunofluorescence. The relative and absolute counts of the lymphocyte subsets were of normal value and did not differ from the counts of flow cytometry and of slide and tube tests.

Activation of human CD4+ and CD8+ cells by Sarcocystis gigantea lectin.	As recently reported, Sarcocystis gigantea lectin (SGL) is a powerful mitogen and a polyclonal activator (Syn. S. ovifelis) of human peripheral B-cells. In the present study we investigated the reactivity of human T-helper (CD4) and T-suppressor (CD8) cells to SGL. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from five newborns and six adults were examined cytofluorometrically for the expression of cell-surface differentiation and activation antigens using a set of seven monoclonal antibodies. In all, 96% of cord-blood and 81% of adult CD4 cells expressed receptors for interleukin-2 (Tac+) after 64 and 164 h microgram/ml). The percentages of neonatal and adult Tac+ CD8 cells amounted to 67% and 59%, respectively. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens identified using the monoclonal anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR antibody L243 were expressed on 30% (CD4) and 44% (CD8) of adult T-cells. Neonatal HLA-DR+ T-lymphocytes were not detectable. In parallel, functional tests were performed to examine cell proliferation and MNC antibody production.

The influence of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 on IgE production in B lymphocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis. A possible criterion for selection of patients for interferon therapy.	The regulation of IgE production in B lymphocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis by interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was studied. IL-4 stimulated IgE production in vitro in B-cells of healthy donors and of children with atopic dermatitis, but had only a marginal effect on the high basal level of IgE production by lymphocytes from adult patients with atopic dermatitis. The addition of IFN-gamma prevented in all cases the stimulation of IgE synthesis induced by IL-4. The production of IgG and IgM was differently influenced. These results indicate that the in vitro production of IgE by mononuclear cells from adult patients is more resistant to the regulatory effects of IL-4 and IFN-gamma than is that in B cells of children with atopic dermatitis. We propose that a previous in vitro test of the responsiveness of IgE-producing B cells to IFN-gamma may be used to select patients with atopic dermatitis for treatment with IFN-gamma.

Splenopentin (DAc-SP5)--influence on engraftment and graft-vs-host reaction after non-H-2 bone marrow transplantation in mice.	The influence of DAc-SP5 on engraftment and graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR) was studied in different non-H-2 strain combinations. The engraftment was more or less enhanced in every case, whereas the situation in the GVHR was completely different. In one case splenopentin did not influence the course of the GVHR so much, in a second case the symptoms of the GVHR were completely abolished, and in a third case the GVHR was dramatically enhanced up to a great mortality. Therefore, before application of DAc-SP5 to the bone marrow transplantation in humans in order to improve the engraftment, parameters have to be found which allow an exact prediction about the influence of splenopentin on the GVHR in each single case.

Polyclonal stimulation of human B lymphocytes derived from fetal liver and spleen cells at different stages of ontogeny.	The functional capacity of human lymphocytes derived from fetal liver and spleen at different stages of ontogeny (16-34 weeks of gestation) was studied using in vitro models (increase in cell volume, [3H]thymidine incorporation, Ig secretion) reflecting various stages of activation induced by mitogens (LPS, PWM) in vitro. Lymphocytes differed in their reactivity to LPS depending on the period of intrauterine development: cells from the early liver could respond with enhanced IgM production whereas lymphocytes derived from this organ after more than 25 weeks failed. The opposite was found to apply to spleen cells: only lymphocytes derived from the organ after more than 25 weeks showed significant LPS-induced in vitro differentiation. These data were in correlation with the proliferative response to LPS. It was clear that the number of CD20-positive mature B cells in the lymphocyte preparations was not responsible for these results, since comparable yields were found throughout the period of fetal development of the liver studied, whereas in the spleen increasing numbers of B cells were seen.

Cytofluorometric and cytomorphologic analysis of human bone marrow cells derived from stromal cultures stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma and splenopentin pentapeptide.	We studied the influence of human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hrGM-CSF), human recombinant interferon-gamma (hrIFN-gamma) and splenopentin pentapeptide (Sp-5), either alone or in combination, on the proliferation and differentiation of human bone marrow cells in modified Dexter's cultures. After 10, 14 and 21 days cells were analyzed by classical staining according to Pappenheim and by cytofluorometry with a set of different monoclonal antibodies. IFN-gamma inhibited the proliferation of progenitor cells and provided signals promoting monocytic differentiation, whereas GM-CSF induced the proliferation of blastoid elements which expressed HLA-DR and M2 (VIM-2 monoclonal antibody), but progressively lost surface CD34. Furthermore, an increase of CD15+ cells was also observed. When GM-CSF was tested in combination with IFN-gamma, it abolished the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma and both cytokines synergized to promote the expression of CD11c, CD14 and M2 surface antigens. Sp-5 alone had only a marginal activity, but it potentiated the effects of GM-CSF. These findings suggest that GM-CSF may induce the transition from stem cells to committed myeloid progenitors. In contrast to IFN-gamma, Sp-5 can serve as an additional proliferative signal with negligible effects on cell maturation.

Phenotyping of lymphocytes following transplantation of allogeneic rat pancreatic islets into streptozotocin-diabetic recipients.	We investigated the phenotypes of peripheral and cervical lymphocytes in allografted pancreatic islet recipients during graft rejection. Grafting 2000 pancreatic islets, obtained from LEW.1A rats, into streptozotocin-diabetic non-immunosuppressed LEW.1W rats acute rejection occurred within 7.0 +/- 0.6 days. Neither the T-cells (W3/13+), nor the T helper (W3/25+) or T-suppressor (OX-8+) lymphocytes were markedly altered during rejection crisis in peripheral or cervical lymphocytes. When using monoclonal antibodies detecting activation markers (OX-17 for class II antigens; ART-18 for interleukin-2 receptor) a significant increase of OX-17+ cells and OX-17+ T-lymphocytes could be observed in lymph node lymphocytes from 24 h after transplantation until 7 days, whereas the peripheral lymphocytes behaved inconspicuously. The results underline the uselessness of peripheral lymphocytes to monitor allogeneic destruction of minimal amounts of grafted tissue by using presently known differentiation and activation markers of lymphocytes.

Splenopentin (DAc-SP-5) accelerates the restoration of myelopoietic and immune systems after sublethal radiation in mice.	In 1981 a new splenic hormone was described by Audhya et al. (Biochemistry, 20, 6195-6200, 1981). At first designated as thymopoietin III, the complete amino acid sequence had been described as splenin in 1984. For the pentapeptide corresponding to amino acids 32-36 of splenin was shown to be active in immunological systems. The synthetic pentapeptide splenopentin (DAc-SP-5) and the sequence 32-36 of splenin are identical. In this study the recovery of immunocompetence in mice following sublethal irradiation is shown to be enhanced by DAc-SP-5. The treatment effects of DAc-SP-5 were verified by splenic plaque-forming response to a T-cell dependent antigen and in the hematopoietic colony-forming assay. These effects were associated with an accelerated recovery of leukocyte counts in peripheral blood and spleen without significant changes in the relation between leukocyte and lymphocyte subpopulations. Furthermore, in comparison to control animals DAc-SP-5 treated mice showed in the first weeks postexposure a significantly higher number of bone marrow derived cells as well as granulocyte-macrophage and macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC and M-CFC). Therefore, DAc-SP-5 may be a useful substance for treating secondary forms of bone marrow depression.

Multireactive human monoclonal antibodies.	Human monoclonal antibodies were tested using different immunochemical procedures for their reactivity with various antigens. The great majority of human monoclonal IgM antibodies (15 out of 24) turned out to bind to a whole series of recognized antigens (DNA, keratin, tetanus toxin, ricin etc.). The specificity of these reactions was detected by competitive assays. For some antibodies a simultaneous reaction with two antigens could be demonstrated by capture bridge technique. IgG antibodies also turned out to be multireactive, but not to the same extent (range of antigens much smaller, only 5-6 out of 53).

Lymphocytes and monocytes with differential and activation antigens were determined by means of the flow cytometry by using monoclonal antibodies in the peripheral blood of patients after organ transplantation. Examinations of the course showed that in this way the acute activity is seized by the cellular immunosystem. Acute reject crises, systemic virus infections, as well as septic states lead to characteristic changes and these verify the diagnostic assertion of this immunomonitoring programme.

[Systemic effects of ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation in serial whole body irradiation. II. Effect on the immune cells of the skin].	Before and after skin treatment by ultraviolet radiation, infrared radiation or visible light the ability of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) to form oxygen intermediates was investigated in 31 healthy volunteers. Superoxide production was evaluated photometrically as the reduction of Iodonitrotetrazoliumchloride (INT). After whole body treatment by 4 UV exposures all persons exhibited significantly enhanced rates of INT-reduction for 26-62 days. The in vivo half-time of PMN is 5-7 hours. Therefore a direct effect of irradiation over that long period is rather unlikely, suggesting that mediators should play a crucial role in signal transduction from the skin to the peripheral blood cells. Most likely candidates for connective links are interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

[Relationship between the immune system and heat shock proteins. A literature review].	Heat shock proteins (HSP) or stress proteins are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in response to a variety of environmental stressors. The heat shock response is one of the most universal reactions known and heat shock proteins are among the most conserved molecules in phylogeny. Recent findings concerning the immune response to heat shock proteins are discussed especially with respect to the role of HSPs postulated in septic disease and inflammation, in antipathogenic immunity and in the induction of autoimmune diseases. Results and speculations considering a relationship between HSPs and gamma/delta T cells or polyreactive antibodies, possibly as part of a phylogenetic old immune system, are critically reviewed.

The hybridization of EBV-immortalized human B-lymphocytes with a human-mouse heteromyeloma cell line.	The combination of Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV)-permitted immortalization and somatic hybridization (fusion with a myeloma partner) may be the method of choice to produce human monoclonal antibodies. We show here that the fusion of EBV-infected human B-lymphocytes to the HAT-sensitive, ouabain-resistent heteromyeloma (human x mouse) fusion line CB-F7, resulted in stable growing hybridomas producing much more immunoglobulin than the parental lymphoblastoid lines. A more efficient clonability was shown for hybridoma cultures too. The loss of B cell markers (HLA-class II antigen, CD-22, CD-37) was detected. Limiting dilution experiments showed a better fusionability of IgM-producing EBV-transformed B cells in comparison to IgG-secreting counterparts.

Immortalization of magnetically separated human lymphocytes by electrofusion.	Human lymphocytes from peripheral blood (MNC) were separated on magnetic beads for the presence of different surface markers. Cells from positive and negative fractions were successfully immortalized by electrofusion with the heteromyeloma line CB-Fu2. B cells, which were separated on anti-CD 19 coated beads, could be immortalized at a rate between 10(-5) and 10(-4) even if the fusion was conducted with just a few hundred thousand cells. Comparison of the frequency of Ig-positive hybridomas in B cell, T cell, and unseparated MNC fusions indicated that also non-B cells may give rise to HAT resistant hybridoma clones, although the fusion frequency was low.

In 10 patients after kidney transplantation the T cell subpopulations (CD4, CD8) and the number of activated lymphocytes (IL-2R and transferrin receptor+, 4F2+, HLA-DR+, CD3+) in the peripheral blood were determined. In 9 out of 9 cases with rejection a clear immune activation could observed. In patients with CMV-associated rejection crisis the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher compared with patients with rejection crisis but without CMV infection. In all patients with CMV infection (n = 5) an increase of activated lymphocytes was observed. In a clinical-immunological monitoring the dynamics of the CD4/CD8 ratio, the expression of activation marker (especially CD3+, HLA-DR+ and 4F2+) and the absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations should included.

Studies on the immunomodulatory effects of anthracycline antibiotics in mice: effects on immune responses and graft immunogenicity.	The immunomodulatory effects of adriamycin, a clinically used tumor antibiotic, were studied. A 5-day course of adriamycin therapy in mice led to a suppression of the primary but not of the secondary humoral response to sheep erythrocytes without significant alterations in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets or lymphocyte subpopulations in the spleen. The delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to ovalbumin or alloantigens was not inhibited. Adriamycin-treated spleen cells were unable to stimulate an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction, which shows that antigen presentation is inhibited by this drug. Adriamycin-treated murine skin grafts show a prolonged survival after allotransplantation despite their unimpaired ability to induce DTH. The possible cellular mechanisms of these effects and clinical relevance of adriamycin are discussed.

Splenopentin-induced reconstitution of the immune response after total body irradiation: optimization of treatment regime.	In former investigations our group obtained an immuno-reconstituting effect in mice treated by immunosuppression after a continuous treatment with splenopentin (SP5). The goal of the present study was to test whether a small number of injections right after immunosuppression possibly produces the same result in the sense of an initial effect. Although a short-term therapy induced an increase of antibody formation which was measurable after 4 weeks, the study clearly showed that only a continuous treatment by SP5 led to an optimum, i.e. complete reconstitution of antibody formation.

The therapeutic efficacy of an anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibody correlates with an increase in serum soluble IL-2 receptor levels.	We tested the capacity of three rat monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), recognizing different epitopes on the L chain of mouse interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R), to block delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and local graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of IL-2R-targeted immunotherapy on serum soluble IL-2R levels by ELISA technique. Following administration of AMT-13 MoAb, in sufficient amounts to suppress both DTH (60-90% inhibition) and local GVHR (55-70% inhibition), an increase in soluble IL-2R levels up to 12-fold was observed. In contrast, the administration of 7D4 MoAb did not show any immunosuppressive effect in vivo and even decreased the soluble IL-2R levels. The third anti-IL-2R MoAb AMT45-20 had an intermediate effect. AMT45-20 MoAb marginally suppressed the DTH as well as local GVHR (15-35% inhibition) and induced only a slight increase in soluble IL-2R levels (up to 4-fold). Both cyclosporin A, a conventional immunosuppressive drug, and the anti-L3T4 MoAb, which defines the entire T helper cell subset, suppressed GVH and DTH response but did not increase the soluble IL-2R serum levels. The increased concentration of soluble IL-2R in the serum of successfully treated mice may be due to destruction of IL-2R-positive cells by anti-IL-2R-targeted immunotherapy and seems to be a sensitive indicator for the success of such a therapy.

Prevention of graft-vs-host reaction induced immunodeficiency by treatment with splenopentin (DAc-SP5).	Early experiments had shown that splenopentin, the active part of the splenic hormone splenin, stimulates the differentiation of virgin B- and T-lymphocytes and significantly enhanced the reconstitution of immune reactions after immune suppression. The present study investigates the influence of splenopentin on the course of the graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR). The experimental model used were adult hybrid mice which received intravenously parental spleen cells. During the GVHR which has an chronical course in the strain combinations used a short stimulatory phase is followed by a long-lasting immunosuppression detected by antibody formation against sheep erythrocytes. Furthermore, the splenomegaly in the first weeks after spleen cell injection changed to a drastic decrease of the spleen weight up to strongly beyond normal values. Continuous treatment with splenopentin significantly prevented both symptoms of the GVHR: The suppression of the antibody formation was diminished widely, and no loss of spleen weight occurred. Furthermore, during the stimulatory phase anti-DNA-autoantibodies were produced in the untreated animals, while the splenopentin therapy prevented this reaction. During the further course of the experiment no increase of autoantibody production was detected later on.

[Ultrastructure of intralobular lymphocyte migration in the liver of hemodialysis patients].	Presence of predominantly small lymphocytes in sinusoids and their immigration into the Disse space as well as into intercellular spaces between hepatocytes were recorded by electron microscopy from liver biopsies of 11 in 18 haemodialysis patients. No degenerative alterations were recordable from adjacent hepatocytes. These findings were obtained from patients with acute hepatitis (one case), minimal or chronic persistent hepatitis (two cases), reactive hepatitis (three cases), lobular and portal hepatitis (one case) as well as from the cases of metabolic-toxic alterations and one case of chronic blood congestion. HBV antigens were serologically identified in six cases. A HBcAg-free HBsAg type was immunohistologically diagnosed in one case only. No correlation was found to exist between the morphological results, on the one hand, and cellular immune pattern in peripheral blood, on the other. The above findings differed from most investigations of hepatitis B cases, in that no evidence could be found to cytotoxic action of lymphocytes upon adjacent hepatocytes. More investigations will be required for interpretation of the above findings, primarily immuno-electron microscopic studies.

The dipeptide Lys-Pro restores the diminished wound healing following treatment with anti-T-helper cell monoclonal antibody.	To determine the role of T-cell subsets in wound healing, we studied the granulation tissue proliferation after depletion of CD4 or CD8 positive cells. Granulation tissue proliferation in CD8-diminished AB mice was significantly higher than in the control group as a result of depleted suppressor cell activity. The CD4-depleted mice produced granulation tissue in less than 30% of the control group. To investigate the role of dipeptidylpeptidase IV on CD4 positive cells in wound healing we used Lys-[Z(NO2)]-Pro, a chemically modified dipeptide which may result by degradation of polypeptides by this peptidase. It was possible to restore the diminished capability of granulation tissue proliferation in CD4-depleted mice by a single treatment with the dipeptide Lys-[Z(NO2)]-Pro. Our results suggest that: (i) the CD4 positive T-helper subset regulates wound healing, and (ii) products of degradation by dipeptidylpeptidase IV may bypass T-helper cell function.

[De novo diabetic glomerulosclerosis in kidney transplants].	Report on 3 cases who had been non-diabetics at the time of cadaver kidney transplantation. After that within 1-5 years diabetes mellitus developed. The patients died 13-14 years after transplantation (9-12 years of diabetes duration). Autopsy revealed typical nodular glomerulosclerosis including diffuse mesangial widening, glomerular aneurysms, exudative lesions, capsular drops, arteriolosclerosis, and in 2 cases with hyalinosis of the vas efferens; moreover, chronic transplant glomerulopathy was found in all cases. Steroid therapy seemed to be responsible for the diabetic state, in 2 cases apparently in combination with disposition.

Phenotypical characterization of the cells invading pancreatic islets of diabetic BB/OK rats: effect of interleukin 2 receptor-targeted immunotherapy.	"We investigated immunohistochemically the phenotypes of mononucleated cells invading pancreatic islets of diabetic BB/OK rats in comparison to the diabetes-resistant parental strain, and 12 and 120 days after a temporary treatment (10 days) with a monoclonal antibody (1 mg/kg b.w.) directed against interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2R) combined with a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporin A (1.5 mg/kg b.w.). Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (OX-19, OX-8, W3/25, KI-M2R, OX-6, OX-17, ART-18) and the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase system to visualize the bound primary antibodies, we observed an even distribution of mononucleated cells across the endocrine pancreas at a ""background"" level when obtained from diabetes-resistant parental rat strain. Diabetic BB/OK rats, characterized by a moderate hyperglycemia and a marked decrease of pancreatic insulin content, displayed a remarkable accumulation of mononucleated cells in the endocrine pancreas. Morphometric studies revealed an increase of all phenotypes investigated, nearly all mononucleated cells expressed class II histocompatibility antigens (OX-6+, OX-17+) and the number of cells expressing the IL 2R (ART-18+) was markedly enhanced. Sixty-seven percent of the immunotherapeutically treated BB/OK rats normalized plasma glucose and enhanced pancreatic insulin content. The successfully treated animals are characterized by a decrease of cells invading pancreatic islets (OX-19+, OX-8+, W3/25+, KI-M2R+), a decrease of class II histocompatibility antigen and IL 2R expression. The number of IL 2R cells is also diminished in the endocrine pancreas of unsuccessfully treated BB rats."

Reversal by interferon-gamma of inhibition of delayed-type hypersensitivity induction by anti-CD4 or anti-interleukin 2 receptor (CD25) monoclonal antibodies. Evidence for the physiological role of the CD4+ TH1+ subset in mice.	In mice, induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and of antibody formation to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was inhibited by the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) GK1.5. However, anti-interleukin 2 mAb AMT-13 inhibited DTH response but not antibody formation. The inhibitory action of the mAb on DTH, but not an antibody formation, was reversed by concomitant injection of recombinant mouse interferon-gamma. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for the postulated physiological role of the CD4+ TH1 lymphocyte subset and indicate that the action of anti-interleukin 2 receptor mAb is restricted to this T helper subset.

[The syndrome of retrograde venous arterialization following arteriovenous vascular anastomoses for hemodialysis].	In 9 patients with arterio-venous side-to-end anastomosis on the forearm as vascular access for chronic hemodialysis an uniform symptom complex was observed: retrograde flow of the ectatic vein into the periphery, swelling and pain in this area, partly with trophic skin disorders on the hand.

A myelopeptide from unstimulated bone marrow cells with immunomodulatory activity in lymphocyte cultures from healthy donors and patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and active lupus erythematosus.	A myelopeptide (SAP) was derived from culture supernatants of unstimulated animal bone marrow. SAP consists of a group of peptides with a molecular weight of about 2000 D, having a broad variety of biological activities. Testing immunoregulatory properties of the purified factor Petrov, Mickhailova & Zacharova [(1971). Immunoglobin synthesis in syngenic cells of different lymphoid tissues. J. Immun., 106 1086-1089] found enhanced antibody production in mice (SAP-stimulator of antibody production). We show here that the substance could induce expression of activation markers on human lymphocytes (4F2, HLA-class II antigens, thermostable SE rosette formation) and potentiate their appearance in combination with mitogens (PWM, PHA, Con A). Although SAP was not mitogenic for itself, it enhanced lectin-induced 3H-thymidine incorporation and T-cell-dependent B-cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. The factor was able to reconstitute disturbed PWM-driven Ig synthesis in lymphocyte cultures derived from two patients with hypogammaglobulinemia and a healthy non-responder to PWM. On the other side, SAP potentiated the inhibitory activity of PWM on elevated spontaneous IgG secretion in cultures derived from patients with active SLE. Findings of this study indicate immunomodulatory capacity of SAP on human peripheral blood lymphocytes possible via T-cell activation. The results suggest a potential therapeutic application of SAP in patients with disturbances in the T-dependent B-cell differentiation.

[Autopsy analysis of the cause of death in patients with kidney transplants].	68 cases of autopsy of 950 patients who underwent a kidney transplantation in Berlin from 1970 to 1986 were analysed with regard to their main disease, the disease directly leading to death and secondary disease. The average age of the deceased was 39.6 years (15-56 years), the duration between kidney transplantation and death was 51.2 months (1-192 months). In the first place there are diseases of the liver (30 times primary disease, 28 times secondary disease), in which cases 24 times a liver cirrhosis was existing and in 11 cases a coma hepaticum caused death. Apart from this septic-septicopyaemic processes (23 times) were of great importance for the exitus, in which cases there were frequently close relations to liver diseases (10 times liver diseases primary disease, 12 times secondary disease). Furthermore are important for the occurrence of death the renal hypertension as well as hemorrhages particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. 15 times a diabetes mellitus was stated, in 13 cases severe changes of bones and joints were diagnosed. 4 times a neoplasia was present (3 times immunocytoma, once liver carcinoma). The diseases diagnosed are to be regarded as a sequela of the primary disease, above all, however, caused by the long-lasting immunosuppressive therapy and the influence on the endocrine system.

Pathology of hepatic peroxisomes in chronic hepatitis B and immunosuppression.	After kidney transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy patients with chronic hepatitis B show not only peroxisome proliferation in hepatocytes but also additional alterations of these organelles: lysis and occasional complete loss of peroxisomes in HBsAg areas as well as lysis and/or autophagocytic degradation of peroxisomes in hepatocytes which contained hepatitis-B virus particles. Two mechanisms are suggested as being significant for the numerical decrease of peroxisomes in HBsAg areas: Reduced neogenesis, but typical lytic degradation; Direct toxic action of immunosuppressive substances. For elucidation further studies have to be undertaken.

The necessary application of immunosuppressive agents leads to the replication of core and surface particles in hepatocytes without any appearance of cell injuries. They become manifest only with the beginning of immunological processes. An analysis of 64 cases of post-mortem examination of persons who underwent a kidney transplantation shows that only 8 had no liver changes and in 24 cases liver diseases were the direct cause of death. From the up to now not yet solved problems results the necessity further to clarify the pathogenesis of liver diseases in patients who underwent a kidney transplantation by means of a combination of clinical, ultrastructural, histologic-immunohistochemica, immunological and laboratory-chemical investigations and to draw conclusions for therapy.

Curing BB rats of freshly manifested diabetes by short-term treatment with a combination of a monoclonal anti-interleukin 2 receptor antibody and a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporin A.	The BioBreeding (BB) rat develops spontaneously a syndrome resembling human type I diabetes mellitus. The short-term treatment of newly diagnosed diabetic BB rats with the anti-interleukin 2 receptor (IL 2R) monoclonal antibody ART-18 in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporin A for 10 days, a treatment shown previously to eliminate specifically antigen-activated IL2R+ T lymphocytes by sparing suppressor cells, resulted in normoglycemia in 70% of the animals, the maintenance of B cell volume density and an increase in pancreatic insulin content. Moreover, the glucose tolerance of successfully treated animals was not significantly different from that of normoglycemic BB rats during the whole observation period (up to 120 days after the end of the therapy). This is the first report on successful treatment of a spontaneous autoimmune disease by a short-term and specific immunosuppressive regimen with limited side effects.

[Modification of in vitro immune mechanisms by various glucocorticosteroid preparations--studies of lymphocytes in healthy probands and autoimmune patients].	The influence of steroids on lymphocyte responses was tested in vitro. The inhibition of early events of lymphocyte stimulation and cell proliferation after PHA stimulation was estimated. We found, however, different individual responses of immune cells of various donors to the preparations dexamethasone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone in both in vitro models tested. Steroid treatment of lymphocyte cultures resulted in both inhibition and enhancement of PWM-driven Ig synthesis in cultures derived from different test persons. In experiments with lymphocytes from patients with acute systemic lupus erythematosus we found a dramatically enhanced PWM-stimulated IgG synthesis which is disturbed in cultures of these patients. The individuality of steroid sensitivity of lymphocyte cultures of healthy test persons and the abnormal reactivity of SLE lymphocytes were discussed in relation to therapeutical applications.

Blocking of interleukin 2 (IL 2) binding to the IL 2 receptor is not required for the in vivo action of anti-IL 2 receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb). I. The production, characterization and in vivo properties of a new mouse anti-rat IL 2 receptor mAb that reacts with an epitope different to the one that binds to IL 2 and the mAb ART-18.	A mouse anti-rat interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor (IL 2R) monoclonal antibody (mAb), ART-65, has been developed. As shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and immunoprecipitation studies, ART-65 recognizes in a species-specific manner the same molecule as does ART-18, a mAb which has been shown previously to recognize the rat receptor for IL 2. ART-65 and ART-18 do not competitively inhibit the binding of each other to activated T cells. ART-65, in contrast to ART-18, does not inhibit the binding of IL 2 to cells nor does it have any inhibitory effect in vitro on IL 2-driven proliferation of rat T lymphoblasts. Therefore, ART-65 is another mAb recognizing the rat IL 2 receptor, but binding to an epitope distinct from that recognized by either IL 2 or ART-18. We compared the in vivo activity of the mAb ART-65 and ART-18 with that of the W3/25 mAb in a local graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR). Similar to the anti-W3/25 treatment, ART-65 and ART-18 inhibited GVHR. The results demonstrate that GVHR depends on a small subpopulation of IL 2R+ cells present in the W3/25+ T cell population because IL 2R-targeted therapy was as effective as the treatment with W3/25 mAb which reacts with the entire T helper cell population. Moreover, the results argue against the possibility that anti-IL 2R mAb act via blockade of the IL 2 binding to IL 2R+ cells and/or by inhibiting the IL 2-driven expansion of the antigen-activated clones. The results support the view that IL 2R-targeted therapy results in the elimination of the IL 2R+ cells.

[Pan T, T4 and T8-positive lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus].	In a group of 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus by means of monoclonal antibodies differentiation markers were investigated on peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. Individual specific differences in the percentage of T1-, T3-, T4- and T8-positive cells were found, indicating various possibilities of immunological disorders in this disease. Furthermore, in comparison with healthy donors, an increased number of T4-, T8-double stained cells was detected in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Normally, this cell phenotype can be detected in the thymus only. Therefore, it becomes necessary to perform parallel and simultaneous determinations, respectively, of several T cell markers in order to gain a more exact insight into the disturbances of the immune system and to exclude incorrect interpretations of the phenotypical distribution of T cell markers.

Influence of hydroxyurea on lectin-induced early and late events in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures.	Activation events induced by lectins in human lymphocyte cultures differed not only in time kinetics of their appearance but were also in a different manner inhibited by hydroxyurea (HU). 4F2 and Tac expression, thermostable sheep erythrocyte rosette formation, cell volume distribution changes and the enhancement of the purine metabolic rate [( 3H]adenine incorporation) induced by PHA, Con A or PWM were not influenced by HU treatment, suggesting G1-phase dependency of these markers. The decrease in the mitogen-induced marker expression after 48 h of incubation with HU can be explained by the unability of activated cells to process the cell cycle, to divide and to become newly positive cells. Mitogen-induced RNA synthesis was partially, DNA synthesis, PWM-induced Ig synthesis and lectin-mediated HLA class II antigen expression were totally inhibited by HU. It holds especially for the DR antigen that its appearance in a polyclonal model of lymphocyte activation occurs in a later (postmitotic G1) phase of the cell cycle. The inhibitory effect of HU on late activation parameters could be removed after washing the cells. Mitogen-activated, HU-treated PBL cultures after removing HU continued cell cycle progression without requirement for further addition of lectin.

The perisinusoidal functional unit in amyloidosis.	The close morphological and functional relations between the various components of the perisinusoidal functional unit may be demonstrated by combination of ultrastructural results with the latest findings in the context of intra-hepatic synthesis and transformation of amyloid. The precursors of amyloid, synthesised in hepatocytes in the region of the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, and plasma membrane of the vascular pole, are moved into the vascular system together with high-density lipoproteins which are probably identical with lipoprotein vesicles close to plasma membranes and in Disse space, and in the vascular system they are transformed to Serum Amyloid A (SAA). A certain role is probably played by Kupffer cells in polymerisation of amyloid A to fibrils. Growing accumulation of fibrils causes ligature and melt-off of peripheral parts from the vascular pole of hepatocytes, with its volume being substantively reduced, so that the spacing between plasma membrane and nucleus may reduce from something between 10 and 12 micron to below 1 micron. There is neither any compression of cytoplasm nor translocation of organelles. Hence, the process can be interpreted as a specific form of atrophy.

"The concept of the ""perisinusoidal functional unit"" of the liver--importance to pathological processes."	"Non-hepatocytes account for 30 per cent of cells in the liver, with sinusoid-coating endothelial and Kupffer cells being the most common types. In addition, there are some scattered pit cells in the wall. Ito cells (perisinusoidal cells, lipocytes) are located in the Disse space. In this paper a review is given of structural and functional changes of cells in response to pathological conditions with reference to the importance of such changes due to diseases of the liver and the organism in large. Cooperation and interaction among non-hepatocytes, the vascular pole of hepatocytes, and Disse space as the site of reaction are summarised under the concept of the ""Perisinusoidal Functional Unit"", and the concept is explained in greater detail by examples (lipoprotein catabolism, processes of phagocytosis, vitamin A storage, virus infections, accumulation of pathological substances, fibrosis, and capillarization)."

The influence of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, prostaglandin E2, and cyclosporine on the polyclonal and anti-DNA antibody secretion in lymphocyte cultures derived from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.	The influence of various immunoregulatory substances was studied in lymphocyte cultures derived from patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by using the model of spontaneous secretion of polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) and anti-DNA autoantibodies. Compared with healthy donors, lymphocytes derived from patients with active SLE disease showed an elevated secretion of total IgG as well as anti-DNA-IgG in vitro, which was associated with an increase in the proportion of activated (HLA-class II +) T cells in their peripheral blood. Recombinant interferon-gamma increases the total IgG/IgM as well as anti-DNA-IgG/IgM secretion, which suggests that it has a possible role in the pathogenesis of SLE disease. Recombinant interleukin-2 and prostaglandin E2 normalize the high, spontaneous total IgG secretion, but elevate anti-DNA-IgG/IgM secretion. These results suggest that autoreactive B-cell clones are regulated differently in SLE patients. Cyclosporine inhibits total IgG/IgM secretion in all patients and anti-DNA-IgG/IgM secretion in six of eight patients. The possible therapeutic use of such immunomodulatory substances in SLE disease is discussed.

Prolongation of rat pancreatic islet allograft survival by treatment of recipient rats with monoclonal anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibody and cyclosporin.	Since interleukin-2-receptor expressing cells play a role in allograft rejection, we investigated the effect of anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody treatment on graft survival of allografted pancreatic islets. When pancreatic islets obtained from Lewis A-rats (haplotype RT1a) were grafted under the kidney capsules of streptozotocin-diabetic Lewis rats (haplotype RT1u), the recipients relapsed into hyperglycaemia within 11 days (7 +/- 1 days). Treatment of the recipient rats with low-dose cyclosporin (1.5 mg/kg body weight) had no effect on allograft survival (9 +/- 1 days). The application of anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody (1 mg/kg body weight) for 10 days resulted in a prolongation of allograft survival (42.5 +/- 15.3, p less than 0.01). In 3 out of 11 animals a permanent normoglycaemia (greater than 120 days) associated with glucose intolerance was observed. When the recipients were treated for 10 days with cyclosporin and anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody, the allograft survival was also prolonged (45.1 +/- 14.6, p less than 0.01); again 3 out of 11 animals remained permanently normoglycaemic while exhibiting a normal glucose tolerance.

Functional properties of lectin-induced thermostable SE rosette (TSER)-forming cells derived from human peripheral blood.	Mitogens are able to stimulate T cells in human peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures to form thermostable rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (TSER). Previously we characterized TSER-forming cells as BL/T2-, DR- and 4F2-positive, e.g. activated T lymphocytes. In this study the evidence is presented that mitogen-induced TSER-forming cells are the responding, proliferating lymphocytes. We studied the sequential activation of human lymphocytes by various mitogens. PHA-induced TSER-forming cells could not been further activated neither by PWM nor by Con A. DNA synthesis rate in Con A-preactivated lymphocytes was enhanced by PHA but not by PWM. PWM-induced TSER-forming cells, however, were further activated as well by PHA as by Con A. These data suggest the heterogeneity of the pathways by which different mitogens activate human immune cells. PWM- and PHA-induced TSER-forming cells could support B lymphocyte differentiation, when PWM was added to the cultures, whereas Con A-preactivated cells failed, indicating different functional activities induced by mitogenic lectins.

[The significance of liver changes as the cause of death in kidney transplant patients (an analysis of 68 autopsy cases)].	An analysis of 68 autopsy cases from a total of 950 patients with renal transplantation in Berlin in 1970-1986 shows an average age at death of 39,6 years (15-56 years). The period between renal transplantation and death averaged 51,2 months (range: 1-912 months). Liver failure was the immediate cause of death in 30 cases. In 28 cases the liver disease was a secondary disease. The risk of dying from a liver disease rose with the interval between renal transplantation and death. 61-192 months after renal transplantation, liver disease was the cause of death in 70% of the deceased. Liver cirrhosis was observed in 24 patients (age 21-56 years) after a period from 24-192 months.

IL-2 normalizes defective suppressor T cell function of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in vitro.	During autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR) both helper and suppressor T cells capable of regulating B cell responses are generated. The proliferative response of T cells as well as the generation of T suppressor cells in the AMLR of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is diminished. In contrast, the T helper cells generated in the AMLR show a hyperactivity. The diminished HLA-class II antigen expression observed on non-T cells of SLE origin was restored by treatment of the cells with gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN). When tested by immunoglobulin secretion, gamma-IFN enhanced T helper cell activity but failed to affect T cell proliferation and T suppressor cell generation in the AMLR derived from patients with SLE. Human recombinant interleukin 2 restores both the proliferative response of T cells and the induction of T suppressor cells in AMLR.

Effects of in-vivo administration of a monoclonal antibody specific for the interleukin-2 receptor on the acute graft-versus-host reaction in mice.	Parental strain T lymphocyte injected into F1 mice respond to allogeneic MHC antigens and so induce the symptoms of a graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR). We have measured the local GVHR by the popliteal lymph node assay, and showed the suppression of the local GVHR in mice by treatment with the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) AMT-13 which is specific against the interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor on activated mouse lymphocytes. The inhibitory effect of the AMT-13 administration was comparable with the suppression of the local GVHR by treatment with L3T4, an MoAb directed against the T helper subset. The L3T4 administration caused a dramatic decrease in the proportion of the cells with the L3T4 phenotype in the circulation and a marginal reduction of these cells in the lymph nodes. In contrast, the AMT-13 treated mice showed no changes in the distribution of the T lymphocyte subsets besides those in the GVHR-stimulated lymph nodes. Obviously, only the small subset of antigen-activated IL-2 receptor-bearing lymphocytes was influenced by treatment with AMT-13. MoAb directed against antigens whose expression is restricted to activated lymphocytes, such as the IL-2 receptor, might become useful for a short term immunosuppression with limited side effects.

The influence of interferon-gamma and various phagocytic stimuli on the expression of MHC-class II antigens on human monocytes--relation to the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates.	Human monocytes show a dose-dependent decrease of the MHC-class II antigen expression (HLA-DR and HLA-DQ) after addition of zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I particles. Interferon-gamma did not prevent this process. The expression of MHC-class I antigens was not affected. The dose-response and kinetic curves showed individual differences. An association between the capacity to form reactive oxygen intermediates and the downregulation of MHC-class II antigen expression was observed. In addition, after digestion of the phagocytosed particles interferon-gamma could restore the MHC-class II antigen expression on the cultured monocytes. The possible biological significance of these interactions between interferon-gamma and phagocytosis for the function of monocytes/macrophages in the local inflammatory process is discussed.

Serum-mediated inhibition of the interferon-gamma-induced HLA-DR expression on monocytes in patients with psoriasis.	Psoriatic patients have a decreased proportion of monocytes expressing class II major histocompatibility complex antigens (DR+ monocytes) in their peripheral blood. The expression of the DR antigen on monocytes after culture in the presence of either autologous lymphocytes (endogenous interferon-gamma, IFN-gamma) or exogenous IFN-gamma was investigated. In normal AB serum the lymphocytes of the majority of the patients showed a spontaneous IFN-gamma production which was sufficient for DR antigen induction, while the monocytes displayed approximate normal susceptibility to exogenous IFN-gamma as judged by DR antigen expression. However, the sera of psoriatic patients contained one or more factors that interfered with the IFN-gamma-mediated DR antigen expression on cultured monocytes of the same patients. Restoration of IFN-gamma-induced DR antigen expression on monocytes in the presence of the patient's sera was achieved by the addition of superoxide dismutase, 2-mercaptoethanol, or indomethacin. The clinical significance of these observations is discussed.

Suppression of the local graft-vs.-host reaction in rats by treatment with a monoclonal antibody specific for the interleukin 2 receptor.	Local graft-vs.-host reaction (GVHR) was induced in rats by injecting parental cells into young F1 recipients. As a consequence of antigenic stimulation in the course of developing GVHR in the responding lymph nodes, the number of interleukin 2-receptor (IL 2R)-bearing T cells increased from less than 1% up to 10% of the total population. The IL 2R-bearing cells were located mainly in the T cell areas of the reactive lymph nodes. As assessed by the determination of the GVHR indices, treatment of the recipients with anti-T-helper subset-specific mAb (W3/25) or with anti-IL 2R mAb (ART-18) inhibited the GVHR. In parallel, the number of IL 2R-bearing cells was reduced to the normal levels. W3/25 mAb treatment changed the helper/suppressor subset ratio and reduced the number of circulating lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. In contrast, ART-18 mAb treatment did not induce any detectable changes in the subset distribution and it did not affect the number of circulating lymphocytes. The results demonstrate the key role that the IL 2R-positive cells play in the proliferative phase of acute GVHR, and favor the use of anti-IL 2R mAb as selective immunosuppressive agents.

Specific immunosuppressive therapy by monoclonal anti-IL 2 receptor antibody and its synergistic action with cyclosporin.	The effects of anti-IL 2R mab treatment on local GVHR and on heterotopic cardiac allograft survival in rats were investigated. Anti IL 2 mab inhibited specifically both GVHR as well as allograft rejection. IL 2R-targeted therapy was superior to that of anti-T helper/inducer cell treatment, as it did not affect T subset distribution and did not reduce the number of circulating T lymphocytes. This therapy when combined with a low subtherapeutic dose of CsA exerted a strongly synergistic effect. The results support the concept of IL 2R-targeted therapy in suppressing undesired immune reactions with limited side effects.

Correlation between the phenotype and the functional capacity of activated T cells in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus.	Activated T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were determined using monoclonal antibodies against activation antigens. Elevated percentages of HLA-DR+ T cells were found in association with active disease. In contrast, we observed an increase in IL-2 receptor-bearing T cells in only six out of 16 patients with active disease. In vitro assays, like spontaneous proliferation, response to IL-2, production of IL-2, and immunoglobulin synthesis have shown that the different patterns of activation antigens are related to different functional stages of T-cell activation. The possible therapeutic consequences are discussed.

Inhibition of HLA-DR antigen expression and of the allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction by photochemical treatment.	Treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with UVB light, the photosensitizing system 8-methoxypsoralen plus UVA light (PUVA), or hematoporphyrin derivative plus visible light leads to an inhibition of their stimulatory capacity in an allogeneic mixed leukocyte reaction despite unaltered expression of HLA-DR antigens when tested immediately after irradiation. However, HLA-DR positive cells disappear among mononuclear cells in the interval between 4 and 8 h after treatment with either UVB, PUVA, hematoporphyrin derivative and light, or heating to 45 degrees C. The expression of HLA-DQ, but not HLA-A,B,C, antigens, was similarly affected by these treatments. The significance of these results is discussed.

Mononuclear cells of a patient with a heterozygous form of chronic granulomatous disease show no alterations in HLA-DR antigen expression after culture with opsonized zymosan.

Postnatal development of hepatocytes following oxygen deficiency in utero.	Pregnant rats were exposed to altitude hypoxia (5,000 m = pO2 11.33 kPa) 8 h daily, from the 16th through 21st d of pregnancy. The livers of the newborn male rats were morphometrically examined by electron microscopy for both qualitative and quantitative parameters, on the 2nd, 5th, 11th and 22nd d of age and were compared with those of controls during the same periods of postnatal development. Substantive changes were exhibited by the mitochondria. Processes of autophagocytic decomposition were recorded (focal vacuolisation, formation of myelin structures). Volume densities on the 2nd (0.2041), 11th (0.2048), and 22nd (0.2495) d of age were clearly higher than in control animals and were all on a rising trend. Numerical density, on the other hand, trebled in the controls (0.0738 on the 2nd d and 0.2261 on the 22nd) and almost doubled in the hypoxia animals (0.0849 on the 2nd d and 0.1471 on the 22nd). In other words, the volume of the average mitochondrion was larger in hypoxia animals, whereas surface densities were lower. Hepatocytes differed from cardiomyocytes, in that increased autophagocytosis of mitochondria and glycogen was recordable from the former only on the 5th d. Glycogen levels of hepatocytes went up considerably, with the rise recorded from controls (0.0181 on the 2nd d and 0.1911 on the 22nd) being somewhat stronger than that observed from hypoxia animals (0.0276 on the 2nd d and 0.1742 on the 22nd). The changes postnatally recorded from liver cells in the wake of prenatal hypoxia are believed to be processes of adaptation which do not cause any irreversible damage.

Pokeweed mitogen induced synthesis of human IgG and IgM in vitro. Technical aspects and the role of adherent cells.	The Pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-inducing in vitro synthesis of human IgG and IgM was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in culture supernatants of PWM-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 83 healthy donors ranging from 24-46 years. Seventy five per cent were characterized as normal responders (200-2000 ng/ml IgG and IgM), 10% classified as high responders (2000-3000 ng/ml), and another 10% had a very high response (more than 5000 ng/ml of both IgG and IgM). One of 83 donors was shown to be a PWM non-responder. In 83 unstimulated cultures from the same donors 660 +/- 75 ng/ml IgG and 60 +/- 10 ng/ml IgM were measured after 8 days of incubation. Ten donors exhibited similar dose dependence of PWM-induced Ig synthesis but differed in time kinetics (optimum between 8 and 12 days of culture). Regression analysis of IgG and IgM production in 83 PWM-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from different healthy donors showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.627. Intracellular Ig in PWM-stimulated cells was quantified by EIA technique after cell lysis in time kinetic experiments. Reproducibility and accuracy of the test system are described in detail. An excess of monocytes of more than 20% in the culture caused an inhibition of the Ig synthesis (calculated on constant numbers of B cells). Monocytes were further immobilized in FCS-coated culture plates and pulsed with PWM for 2 h. Adding unstimulated, nonadherent cells to the plates after removing the mitogen resulted in an Ig production comparable to that with the classical method.

A sensitive and class specific solid phase enzyme immunoassay for anti-DNA autoantibodies in supernatants of lymphocyte cultures and human hybridomas.	A solid phase enzyme immunoassay using methylated bovine serum albumin (BSA)-precoated and DNA-coated microtiter plates was developed for the detection of IgG and IgM anti-DNA autoantibodies in the supernatants of lymphocyte cultures and hybridomas. In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) the significantly raised IgG anti-DNA antibody synthesis indicates that preactivated anti-DNA clones circulate in the peripheral blood. This was associated with the detection of anti-DNA antibodies in the sera. The screening of 53 supernatants from human x mouse hybridomas showed an antibody to denatured DNA in 16 supernatants.

[The vascular pole of hepatocytes: structure, function and pathology].	Structural and functional subdivision of the hepatocyte into a sinusoidal (vascular) zone, a lateral zone and a peri-canicular zone (adjacent to the bile canaliculi) highlights certain peculiarities of the vascular hepatocyte pole. In contrast to the total cytoplasm, this area is characterized by a high volume of mitochondria, altered peroxisome content, a high concentration of lipids and the absence of Golgi-apparatus. Of critical importance is the sinusoidal cell membrane: at birth, the hepatocyte of the rat bears some 1,000 microvilli, rising to 4,600 in the mature animal. The surface to volume ratio of this part of the cell is more than 250% of the overall cell ratio. The ectoplasmic area beneath it is of importance to the structural integrity and function of the cell membrane itself. Pathological changes such as formation of blebs, shedding of cytoplasm, detachment of portions of the vascular pole, emergence of phagocytic processes, production of atypical substances (i.e. amyloid precursors), are closely and interactively related to pathologic processes of other elements of this region (non-hepatocyte, space of Disse). The peri-sinusoidal functional complex, may have an importance for the pathology of the liver which has not been fully appreciated to date.

Differences in interferon-gamma response of psoriatic lymphocytes to stimulation with various mitogens.	Upon ConA stimulation, peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from psoriatic patients show an impaired IFN-gamma production. Normal IFN-gamma values were obtained, however, with PHA or PWM as inducers. Moreover, psoriatic cells responded well to vesicular stomatitis virus as inducer of IFN-alpha. Thus, the defect is not an all-out inability of all lymphocytes to produce IFN, but rather a failure to respond to weak mitogenic stimuli. Possible mechanisms are discussed.

[The sinusoid wall of the liver in viral infections].	"The elements of the ""peri-sinusoidal functional complex"" (i.e. non-hepatocytes, space of Disse, vascular pole of hepatocytes) can react to the presence of virus in the sinusoidal blood stream by retaining viruses, sometimes followed by viral proliferation, by reactive proliferation, or by degenerative changes in the cells which may culminate in cell death. Immune processes may be also activated or alternatively, there may be no response whatever to the viremia. In hepatitis B infection the principal changes are in the Kupffer cells and in the vascular pole of the hepatocytes. Along with immunologic responses there are proliferative and degenerative events in the Kupffer cells, which may deleteriously affect the sinusoidal cell membrane of the hepatocytes. These factors, as well as the receptor structure of these cell membranes, are regarded as responsible for the uptake of virus in the hepatocyte. Cytotoxic T-cells which have migrated to the region also play a role in the overall process. The point should be made, however, that these concepts are largely hypothetical and that hepatitis B virus particles have yet to be demonstrated in the peri-sinusoidal complex."

[Influence on the immune response of C-reactive protein (CRP)].	The influence of C-reactive protein (CRP) on early and late parameters of mitogen-induced lymphocyte activation in vitro has been tested. Early activation markers (increase of cell size and formation of thermostable SE rosettes) and the lymphocyte proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation) were changed by CRP (10-50 micrograms/ml), whereas PWM-induced stimulation was inhibited and PHA-induced activation was enhanced. Production of human immunoglobulins in vitro in culture from 12 healthy donors was influenced by CRP in a different manner. Modulation of mitogenic responses of lymphocytes by CRP occurs in an early stage of the cell cycle. Responsible for this phenomenon can be soluble factors, which were removed from the culture by washing the cells after 24 hrs. We discuss here the unspecific modulatory role of CRP in various immune-mediated diseases.

Various plant lectins differentiate in their ability to induce early (chemiluminescence and thermostable rosette formation) and later (DNA synthesis) activation events of human mononuclear cells. Both phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A induced a cell activation detectable by the three investigated parameters. Wheat germ agglutinin was characterized as an efficient stimulator in both assays of early events whereas the induction of DNA synthesis measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation was low. In contrast, pokeweek mitogen did evoke only a weak chemiluminescence signal, but induced a small number of thermostable rosettes and a high [3H]-thymidine incorporation. The results obtained from experiments with mononuclear cells of twelve healthy donors did not show a firm correlation between the investigated three parameters of cell activation.

Normal values and membrane markers of theophylline-sensitive and theophylline-resistant human T-lymphocytes.	In 32 healthy adults between 20 and 50 years, the number of theophylline-resistant T-lymphocytes (T-res) was determined to be 51 +/- 4% or 1,161 +/- 326 per microliter, and that of theophylline-sensitive T-lymphocytes (T-sens), 11 +/- 2% or 252 +/- 95.--The decrease in number of rosette-forming cells after incubation with 1 mM theophylline was not caused by reduced vitality (51Cr-release test). The testing of various theophylline concentrations (1, 3, 5, and 10 mM) did not result in a changed count of T-sens. By a variation of the lymphocyte: sheep erythrocyte ratio and of incubation temperature it was found that T-sens possess high-affine and T-res low-affine receptors for sheep erythrocytes. While about 30% of the cells of both subpopulations proved to have Fc-IgM-receptors, among T-sens a significantly higher number of cells carried Fc-IgG-receptors than among T-res (29% vs. 10%).

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV in human T lymphocytes. An approach to the role of a membrane peptidase in the immune system.	Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV), an ectoenzyme in the cell membrane of human T lymphocytes, is an important constituent in the process of lymphocyte activation and proliferation. In the presence of specific inhibitors and antibodies against DP IV several in vitro functions of activated lymphocytes were found to be impaired. These include mitogen induced DNA synthesis, immunoglobulin secretion and production of interferon-gamma. The functional importance of DP IV during activation of lymphocytes is underlined by an increase in cellular DP IV activity upon mitogenic stimulation.

Histamine (10(-4) M) suppressed the PHA-induced activation of lymphocytes in vitro.

Histamine affect these phenomenons only when added to the culture during the first hours. Already 6 hrs after addition of PHA, it exerted no significant suppression. The target of the inhibiting effect of histamine is the G0-G1-transition of the lymphocytes. Cells that already had entered the G1-phase were no more susceptible to histamine.

The influence of haematoporphyrin derivative and visible light on murine skin graft survival, epidermal Langerhans cells and stimulation of the allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction.	The influence of combined photochemical treatment with a haematoporphyrin derivative and visible light on antigen-presenting cells was evaluated. Treatment of murine skin grafts with this procedure prolonged their subsequent survival on allogeneic recipients. The haematoporphyrin derivative and light decreased the ATPase activity of epidermal Langerhans cells in murine skin. When stimulator cells in a human allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction were treated with the haematoporphyrin derivative and light, they lost their stimulatory capacity. It is proposed that the haematoporphyrin derivative and visible light interfere, on analogy with ultraviolet radiation, with the function of antigen-presenting cells.

Decrease of HLA-DR antigen expression by human monocytes during cultivation in absence of exogenous or endogenous interferon-gamma.	The kinetics of HLA-DR antigen expression by human peripheral blood monocytes during cultivation in vitro was studied. Immediately after separation by glass adherence, about 60% of monocytes expressed DR antigens as judged by indirect fluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody (BL-DR/1). Monocytes carefully depleted of lymphocytes, gradually lost their DR antigens during cultivation in the absence of exogenous interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). However, addition of a few lymphocytes to the adherent cells prevented the decrease of DR antigen expression. Furthermore, it was shown that doses as low as 1 IU/ml of IFN-gamma are sufficient to induce DR antigen expression by cultured monocytes. Experiments with cyclosporin A suggest that lymphocytes contaminating the monocyte preparations can produce spontaneously sufficient amounts of IFN-gamma for maintenance of the DR antigens on monocytes.

Lectin-induced thermostable SE-rosette (TSER) formation by human peripheral blood lymphocytes.	Lectin-activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes were able to form thermostable rosettes with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). Capability to form thermostable rosettes (TSER) after lectin treatment was comparable in time kinetics and dose dependence to cell size distribution changes. Enhancement of TSER formation by human lymphocytes exposed to PHA and Con A, however, occurred before 3H-Thymidine incorporation could been registered. Lectin treatment of lymphocytes from 20 healthy donors for 48 hrs induced 49 +/- 4% (PHA), 33 +/- 5% (Con A), and 20 +/- 2% (PWM) thermostable rosette forming cells, whereas in unstimulated cultures were found 4 +/- 1%. Furthermore, thermostable rosette forming cells were enriched by gradient centrifugation and characterized as activated lymphocytes of T-origin by SE rosetting and binding studies with various monoclonal antibodies. It was shown that preparation of TSER forming cells after lectin activation makes it possible to enrich the fraction of lectin-stimulated T lymphocytes.

[Human T-lymphocytes--clinical and methodological studies on the detection of Fc-IgM- and Fc-IgG-receptor bearing T-lymphocytes (Tm and Tg)].	Several methodical aspects for determination of T lymphocytes with Fc receptors for IgM (TM) and IgG (TG) were studied including separation technique of T cells with E-rosetting, culture conditions of T cells for determination of TM and the rosetting of TM and TG with EA complexes. The bests results were obtained by stabilization of E-rosettes with human serum albumin, after separation of E-rosette forming cells lysis of sheep erythrocytes with save hypotonic shock, culturing of T cells in medium containing 20% AB Serum. Furthermore it was shown the possibility using EA complexes produced with not purifieded IgG or IgM anti-ox-red-blood cells antisera without lost of specifity for TM and TG. The percentage of TM and TG in peripheral blood of thirty healthy persons as well as monitoring TM and TG in three cases was investigated.

A simple and rapid method for detecting and separating T lymphocytes by rosetting with autologous erythrocytes.	Counting and separation of auto-rosette-forming lymphocytes is a critical procedure since autologous rosettes are very unstable. It was demonstrated that human serum albumin efficiently stabilizes autologous rosettes, and makes it possible to distinguish at least three T-cell subsets by their different affinities for autologous erythrocytes. About 1% of T-cells have a high affinity for autologous erythrocytes and about 30% intermediate affinity. With a careful procedure, it is possible to detect a further subpopulation with very low affinity for erythrocytes. The sum of these three subsets was about 75% of the T-cells in the peripheral blood.

[Autologous mixed lymphocyte culture (AMLC)].	The autologous mixed lymphocyte culture (AMLC) in humans has been reviewed. Normal human T cells are stimulated to proliferate in vitro when co-cultured with mitomycin-C-treated or X-irradiated autologous non-T-cells. This reactivity, termed autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction, is thought to represent a self-recognitive mechanism that might be important in regulating the cellular interactions involved in the generation of normal immune response. The nature of the stimulator cell remains a matter of controversy, with evidence suggesting that monocytes, B cells, or dendritic cells may be the major stimulatory populations. In addition, activated T cells expressing HLA-D/DR antigens are also capable of stimulating autologus T cells in AMLC. It was shown that treatment of stimulator cells with anti-HLA-DR antibodies resulted in a significant decrease in their stimulatory capacity in AMLC. These observations suggest that HLA-D/DR antigens, the human counterpart of murine Ia antigens coded for by the I-E subregion of the H-2 complex, expressed on non-T cells or activated T cells participate in the stimulation of AMLC. However, recent findings would suggest that HLA-DS, the human equivalent of murine I-A, is more important than HLA-DR in inducing proliferation in the AMLC. The nature of the T cell subpopulations stimulated by autologous non-T cells has not been clearly elucidated. Evidence has been presented to suggest that either helper T cells or suppressor T cells, as well as cytotoxic cells may be activated. Recent evidence involving the use of monoclonal antibodies that identify mutually exclusive T cell subsets suggests only T cells with the T4+ (helper/inducer) phenotype are triggered directly, but in the presence of such cells, T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells may also be activated. The T cells which respond in AMLC are a subset of the Con A-responsive T cell population and are separate from allogeneic MLC-responding T cells. Furthermore, the responding cells are T cells forming rosettes with autologous erythrocytes and have surface and functional characteristic of post-thymic precursors. Recent studies indicate that in AMLC between T and non-T cells or T and activated T cells phenotypically distinct subpopulations of T lymphocytes respond by proliferation and express distinct immunoregulatory function. Thus, it seems that distinct species of Ia antigens expressed on activated T cells as opposed to those expressed on non-T cells could participate in the triggering process for the stimulation of functionally distinct human T cell subpopulations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Allergie und Immunologie	1984-01-01		['Volk,HD', 'Grunow,R']	[None, None]

[Immunostimulation by 2-cyanoethylurea: accelerated rejection of skin allografts in mice].	2-Cyanoethylurea (2; CEU or BA 1-4) obtainable from 1-carboxamido-2-cyanoaziridine (2; BA l) by ring fission possesses immunomodulating properties like its parent compound containing the intact aziridine ring, as well as other 2-cyanoaziridine (1) derivatives. As was shown in a mouse model, CEU accelerated the time of rejection of skin allografts (immunostimulation) and reduced the prolonged tolerance time of mice immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide to values found in normal control animals (immunorestoration).
